# Architecture overview

## System architecture

OpenHuman’s desktop UI is a **React 19** app (`app/src/`) that:

- Uses **Redux Toolkit** with persistence for session-related state
- Connects to the backend with **REST** (`apiClient`) and **Socket.io** (`socketService`)
- Calls the **Rust core** process over HTTP via **`coreRpcClient`** / Tauri **`core_rpc_relay`** (JSON-RPC methods implemented in repo root `src/openhuman/`, exposed through `core_server`)
- Loads **AI prompts** from bundled `src/openhuman/agent/prompts` (repo root) and from Tauri **`ai_get_config`** when packaged
- Uses a **minimal MCP-style** helper layer under `lib/mcp/` (transport, validation) — not a large in-repo Telegram MCP tool bundle

## Entry points

| File                    | Purpose                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `app/src/main.tsx`      | React root, Sentry boundary, store, global styles                                    |
| `app/src/App.tsx`       | Provider chain: Redux → PersistGate → User → Socket → AI → Skill → Router            |
| `app/src/AppRoutes.tsx` | `HashRouter` routes, `ProtectedRoute` / `PublicRoute`, onboarding and mnemonic gates |

## Provider chain

```
Redux Provider
  └─ PersistGate
      └─ UserProvider
          └─ SocketProvider
              └─ AIProvider
                  └─ SkillProvider
                      └─ HashRouter
                          └─ AppRoutes (pages + settings)
```

**Why this order**

1. Redux is outermost for `useAppSelector` / dispatch everywhere.
2. `PersistGate` rehydrates persisted slices before children assume stable auth.
3. `SocketProvider` uses the auth token for Socket.io.
4. `AIProvider` / `SkillProvider` wrap features that depend on socket and store state.
5. `HashRouter` supplies navigation to all routes.

## Module relationships (simplified)

```
App.tsx
  ├─ Redux store + persistor
  ├─ UserProvider — user profile / workspace context
  ├─ SocketProvider — connects socketService when token present
  ├─ AIProvider — AI session / memory client coordination
  ├─ SkillProvider — skills catalog and sync
  └─ AppRoutes
       ├─ PublicRoute — e.g. Welcome on `/`
       ├─ ProtectedRoute — onboarding, home, skills, settings, …
       └─ DefaultRedirect — unauthenticated users
```

## Services layer (conceptual)

```
services/
  ├─ apiClient        → REST to a URL resolved at runtime via `services/backendUrl#getBackendUrl`
  ├─ backendUrl       → Calls `openhuman.config_resolve_api_url`; falls back to VITE_BACKEND_URL only outside Tauri
  ├─ socketService    → Socket.io; realtime + MCP-style envelopes
  └─ coreRpcClient    → HTTP to local openhuman core (JSON-RPC), used with Tauri relay
```

### Runtime config precedence

The desktop app does not bake the core RPC URL or the API host into the
bundle as a hard requirement. At runtime the app resolves them in this order
(highest first):

1. **Login-screen RPC URL field** — saved via `utils/configPersistence` and
   restored on next launch. End users configure the sidecar address here, not
   by hand-editing `config.toml` or `.env` files.
2. **Tauri `core_rpc_url` command** — the port the bundled sidecar is
   listening on for this process.
3. **`VITE_OPENHUMAN_CORE_RPC_URL`** — build-time fallback for development.
4. The hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:7788/rpc` default.

Once the RPC handshake succeeds, `services/backendUrl` calls
`openhuman.config_resolve_api_url` to pull `api_url` (and other safe client
fields) from the loaded core `Config`. `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is only used as a
web fallback when the app runs outside Tauri.

Components that need the backend URL should call `useBackendUrl()` (or
`getBackendUrl()` from non-React code) — they must not import the static
`BACKEND_URL` constant from `utils/config`, which represents the build-time
value only.
