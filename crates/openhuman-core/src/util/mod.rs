//! Utility functions for `OpenHuman`.
//!
//! Kernel family — always compiled, never gated. Self-contained helpers
//! reused across domains; nothing here may reach into a domain (no `use
//! crate::` anywhere in this directory).
//!
//! - [`text`]     — UTF-8-safe truncation, char-boundary rounding, provenance tags
//! - [`retry`]    — retry-with-backoff + transient-filesystem-error classification
//! - [`sanitize`] — LLM-facing text sanitization (control-char stripping,
//!   instruction-fence removal, UTF-8-safe byte caps)
//! - [`bm25`]     — BM25 ranking over short documents (tool + skill search)
//! - [`tls`]      — platform-conditional `reqwest::ClientBuilder` factory
//! - [`types`]    — shared utility types
//!
//! `retry`, `text`, and `types` items are re-exported at the module root, so
//! `crate::util::<fn>` (and `openhuman_core::util::<fn>` from outside, the
//! path the `truncate_with_ellipsis` doctest uses) resolves without naming the
//! submodule. `bm25`, `redact`, `sanitize`, and `tls` are reached through
//! their submodule path.
//!
//! See [`README.md`](README.md) for a per-file breakdown.
