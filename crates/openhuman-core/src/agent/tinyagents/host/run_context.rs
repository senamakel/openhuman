//! OpenHuman's explicit, host-owned state for one agent run.
//!
//! `tinyagents_harness::context::RunContext` owns generic runtime mechanics.
//! This type owns the product values that used to be recovered from ambient

//! parent dispatch state, and the handles a tool needs to continue a run.
//! The shared turn seam receives this as its live OpenHuman carrier. The live
//! middleware registry uses this type as the TinyAgents run context,
