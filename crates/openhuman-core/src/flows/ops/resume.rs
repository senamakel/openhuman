/// Computes a stable content hash of the flow configuration a run was approved
/// against — the T-M1 stale-approval guard (see `flows_resume`'s doc).
/// Persisted on a run row the moment it parks at `pending_approval`, and
/// recompared against the **current** flow before a resume is allowed to
/// execute, so a rewrite between park and resume is detected instead of
/// silently firing the new configuration under the old approval.
///
/// Covers the graph **and `require_approval`**. The flag is not cosmetic: it
/// feeds `workflow_origin(...)`, which becomes the `AgentTurnOrigin` for the
/// whole resumed execution, and `TrustedAutomationSource::Workflow {
/// require_approval: false }` **auto-allows every `external_effect` tool call**
/// where `true` parks each one for its own human decision. It is also settable
/// independently of the graph — `flows_update(.., graph_json: None,
/// require_approval: Some(false), ..)` leaves `.graph` byte-identical. Hashing
/// the graph alone would therefore leave the exact hole this guard exists to
/// close: park at a gate, user approves, the flag is flipped to `false` with the
/// graph untouched (pin still matches), and on resume every downstream
/// outbound node that would have parked now fires unattended.
///
/// Hashes a *canonicalized* JSON serialization — `serde_json::Value`'s object
/// map preserves insertion order in this crate (the `preserve_order` feature
/// is enabled transitively via other dependencies), so the same logical graph
/// serialized through two different code paths is not guaranteed to emit its
/// object keys in the same order. [`canonicalize_json`] recursively sorts
/// every object's keys before hashing so the hash depends only on graph
/// content, never on incidental key order. Returns `None` (never panics) if
/// the graph somehow fails to serialize.
///
/// **`None` means different things on the two sides, and the resume side fails
/// CLOSED.** At park time `None` simply stores no pin, so that run later takes
/// the legacy "unknown — allow, with a warning" path. At resume time the
/// comparison is `Some(expected) != None`, which is *true*, so a hash failure
/// is treated as a mismatch: the run is refused, settled terminally, and its
/// checkpoint dropped. That is the safer direction — a run whose current graph
/// cannot be hashed is a run whose approval cannot be verified — but it is the
/// opposite of fail-open, so do not read this as a guarantee that a serialize
/// failure leaves a resumable run resumable.
