//! The profile lease, as the [`ProfileHost`](super::ProfileHost) uses it.
//!
//! Exactly one process hosts a profile at a time. Before opening one, the
//! host takes its lease (`storage::lease`): from the shared backend's
//! [`DocumentLeases`] when a storage URL is configured, so every node of a
//! deployment contends for the same records, else from [`LocalLeases`]
//! (`flock` on `<root>/users/<id>/.lease`), which keeps two processes on one
//! root apart.
//!
//! While a profile is open its lease is renewed every third of the TTL
//! ([`heartbeat`]). A renewal that finds the record changed — another node
//! took the profile over, or an operator released it — fences the profile:
//! it is marked fenced, its in-flight turns are cancelled, and it is closed,
//! so this node stops writing its state. The same happens when renewals keep
//! failing until the grant would have expired.
