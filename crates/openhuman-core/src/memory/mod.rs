//! Memory: TinyMemory's agent lifecycle, bound to OpenHuman
//! (`docs/specs/memory-v2.md`; contract and lifecycle in `vendor/tinymemory`).
//!
//! | Module | Role |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`engine`] | Binds the `[memory]` engine (`tinyhumans` over the host's backend credential, or `cortexdb` with a stored key); memory is **off** without one |
//! | [`guard`] | Scrubs secrets and PII from every write, whichever path it takes |
//! | [`scope`] | Who is acting: the layout root and memory agent id a turn runs as |
//! | [`lifecycle`] | The turn hooks (pre-turn pack, post-turn log, compaction recall) and the background job queue |
//! | [`ops`] | Engine selection, recall, fetch, learn, forget, list, the pack preview |
//! | [`brain`] | The shared brain: documents by source type |
//! | [`sources`] | The `[[memory.sources]]` registry and sync into the brain (folder, file, link, github, rss, composio) |
//! | [`channels`] | Which channel each logged thread arrived on, for forgetting a channel |
//! | [`backfill`] | Consent-gated storing of chats from before turns were logged |
//! | [`import`] | Consent-gated, resumable import of a v1 store |
//! | [`tools`] | The single `memory` agent tool |
//! | [`bus`] | The cron subscriber (source sync, background jobs) |
//! | [`schemas`] | The `openhuman.memory_*` controllers |
//!
//! Chat thread persistence is not memory: it lives in [`crate::threads::store`].
