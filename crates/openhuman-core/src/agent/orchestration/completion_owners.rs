//! Which SaaS profile a detached sub-agent's completion belongs to, for the
//! bus subscriber that delivers it.
//!
//! The background-completion tables are keyed per profile
//! (`tenant::profile_key`), but the delivery subscriber
//! ([`super::background_delivery`]) runs off-task with no `CoreContext` scope,
//! so in SaaS it cannot read them. [`record_outcome`] runs inside the user's
//! scope: it notes the profile here under the sub-agent's task id (core-minted,
//! unique) and the parent session id, and the subscriber re-enters that
//! profile's context ([`context_for_profile`]) before it looks anything up.
//!
//! A session id is not unique across profiles (a web-chat one is
//! `{client_id, thread_id}`), so it can name several owners; each is drained in
//! its own scope, where it can only reach its own tables. Desktop contexts
//! carry no profile, so nothing is noted there and delivery stays unscoped.
//!
//! [`record_outcome`]: super::background_completions::record_outcome
