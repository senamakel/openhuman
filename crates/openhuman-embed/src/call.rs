//! The typed dispatch helper every facade method is built on.
//!
//! # Why this goes through `invoke` rather than calling `ops::*` directly
//!
//! Calling a domain's `ops::*` function directly would be more strongly typed
//! and would skip a serde round-trip — but it would also **bypass
//! [`DomainSet`](openhuman_core::core::runtime::DomainSet) gating entirely**. Gating
//! works by not registering a domain's controllers at the single registration
//! site (`crates/openhuman-core/src/core/all.rs`); the `ops` functions themselves remain perfectly
//! callable. A facade built on `ops::*` would therefore happily serve a domain
//! the embedder explicitly switched off, and [`CoreError::Unavailable`] could
//! never be produced.
//!
//! Dispatch is also where [`CoreContext`](openhuman_core::core::runtime::CoreContext)
//! scoping already happens ([`CoreRuntime::invoke`] wraps the handler future in
//! `CoreContext::scope`), so routing through it means ambient workspace and
//! domain state are correct for free.
//!
//! The cost is a JSON round-trip and stringly-typed method names. Both are paid
//! *here*, once, so that no host ever sees them.
//!
//! # The response envelope
//!
//! Controller handlers serialize through
//! [`RpcOutcome::into_cli_compatible_json`](openhuman_core::rpc::RpcOutcome), which emits
//! a **variable shape**:
//!
//! - no logs  → the value itself
//! - any logs → `{"result": <value>, "logs": [...]}`
//!
//! Whether a given method carries logs is an implementation detail of its
//! handler and can change without notice — `openhuman.config_get_runtime_flags`,
//! for instance, always emits exactly one log, so it is *always* wrapped. A
//! caller that deserialized the raw value would break on that method every
//! single time, and would break on others only after an unrelated edit added a
//! log line. [`unwrap_outcome_envelope`] absorbs that here so no facade method
//! and no host has to think about it.
