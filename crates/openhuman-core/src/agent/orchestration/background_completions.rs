//! Host adapter over the harness `CompletionRouter` for finished detached
//! background sub-agents (`spawn_async_subagent`).
//!
//! The queue itself is the harness's: `tinyagents_tasks::CompletionRouter`
//! deduplicates by task id, holds tombstones (collected inline, stopped,
//! cancelled parent), counts delivery attempts, hands back the records that
//! gave up, and persists every transition to a per-workspace
//! `JsonlCompletionStore`, so a completion that was never delivered is
//! delivered after a restart. This module is the thin host seam over it:
//!
//! * one router per workspace, opened lazily next to the task ledger
//!   (`<workspace>/.openhuman/background_completions.jsonl`);
//! * the router's parent key is the **chat thread id** — delivery is
//!   thread-addressed, and a thread-scoped cancel (Stop, delete, purge) is then
//!   the router's own `cancel_parent` / `resume_parent`;
//! * the product-specific lifecycle helpers (`record_failure`,
//!   `record_awaiting_input`, `mark_collected`, ...) the spawn, wait, cancel and
//!   thread paths call.
//!
//! When a parent is idle enough to receive a delivery turn, and the turn itself,
//! stays in [`super::background_delivery`]. The wording is
//! [`super::completion_notice`].
