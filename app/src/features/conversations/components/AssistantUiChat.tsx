 * Keep the host's draft (`inputValue`) and assistant-ui's composer text in step.

 * Two directions, and the one that fires on every keystroke is the dangerous
 * one. Editor → host used to call `onChange` (a `useState` setter) inside this
 * effect synchronously. A keystroke is a discrete event, so React flushes the
 * effect — and the update it schedules — synchronously too, and a burst of
 * keystrokes (key-repeat, fast typing, an automated driver) chained those sync
 * updates past React's nested-update limit: "Maximum update depth exceeded",
 * and the whole chat surface fell to the error boundary.
 *
 * So editor → host now runs as a transition, which is not a sync update. The
 * host value then lags the editor by a render, and the other direction must
 * not mistake that lag for a host write: a host value that is one we emitted
 * ourselves is an echo and is never written back into the editor (doing so
 * would overwrite what was typed since). Only a value we did not emit —
 * dictation, ESC restore, clear after send — is a host write, and it wins.
