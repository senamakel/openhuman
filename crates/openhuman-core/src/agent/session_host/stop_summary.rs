//! The reply a user reads when the failure breaker stopped a turn and no
//! model-written close could be used.
//!
//! It used to open with "my tool calls were not making progress" whatever the
//! cause, quote the breaker's stop note (written for the model, not the user)
//! and dump every tool result verbatim; one such dump carried a user's profile
//! email and IP address. This one gives a single plain-language reason derived
//! from the stop note's failure class, collapses identical results into one
//! line with a count, and shows at most each tool's name and one short,
//! scrubbed error line. No tool output is reproduced.
//!
//! Localization: assistant text the core writes has no locale path yet (the
//! chat surface localizes only `chat_error` events, through
//! `inference::failure_copy`'s `copy_key`). The copy is therefore English, but
//! every reason is a [`StopReasonKind`] with a stable `turn_stop.*` key, so a
//! locale table can replace [`StopReasonKind::copy`] without touching the
//! classification.
