//! Config sub-facade — the first typed surface, and the proof of the pattern.
//!
//! Every other sub-facade (memory, workflows, chat, …) follows the
//! shape established here:
//!
//! 1. A borrowed newtype over `&Arc<CoreRuntime>` — zero-cost, no state.
//! 2. Facade-owned serde types, so hosts never name a domain's internal type
//!    and never touch `serde_json::Value`.
//! 3. Two-line methods delegating to `call`.
//!
//! Config is deliberately first because it is registered under
//! `DomainGroup::Platform`, which every preset enables — so a failure here is
//! unambiguously a facade bug rather than a gating question.
//!
//! # Host helpers
//!
//! Beside the [`Config`] sub-facade, this module carries the few free
//! functions a host needs *before* (or outside) a runtime: locating the
//! OpenHuman root, reading the active user marker, and loading the config the
//! way the core does. The core's full config type is [`RuntimeConfig`].
