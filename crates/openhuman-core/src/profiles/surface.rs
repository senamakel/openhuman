//! What a user may call in SaaS mode.
//!
//! A profile's context enables a few domain families
//! ([`host::user_domains`](super::host::user_domains)), but a family is too
//! coarse to open whole: `threads` also holds operations that start model
//! turns or reach the host. So in a user's scope every RPC method must also
//! be on [`USER_METHODS`], an explicit, reviewed allowlist. The registry
//! applies it at dispatch, in the controller list and in `/schema` alike
//! (`core::all`), so an unlisted method is indistinguishable from an absent
//! one.
//!
//! The operator plane and single-user processes are unaffected.
