/// `ToolScope::Named` is built with `visible` = its named list, which cannot
/// contain a *synthesised* delegate like `setup_skills`; those names arrive
/// later, when `refresh_delegation_tools` inserts them. So at build time no
/// hand-off looked reachable and nothing closed, while a harness agent — whose
/// empty visible set is seeded from every tool, synthesised ones included —
/// closed correctly. The live orchestrator kept its raw `skill_registry_*` /
/// `mcp_registry_*` route the whole time (#6302). Pack membership is knowable
