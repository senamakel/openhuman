//! Server-side legacy RPC method aliases.
//!
//! Mirrors the frontend's `LEGACY_METHOD_ALIASES` table in
//! `app/src/services/rpcMethods.ts`. The frontend rewrites outgoing method
//! names for clients that just updated; this module rewrites incoming
//! method names for clients that haven't updated yet (older shipped bundles
//! in the wild). Together they form a symmetric migration safety net:
//! either side can be the one that's behind, and the call still resolves.
//!
//! When adding or removing an entry here, keep
//! `app/src/services/rpcMethods.ts:LEGACY_METHOD_ALIASES` in sync. The two
//! tables are intentionally identical: the same legacy → canonical map
//! applied at both ends of the wire.
//!
//! The rewrite is a pure key-to-key lookup. No domain branches, no
//! parameter inspection — if a method isn't in the table, it passes through
//! untouched.

/// Legacy → canonical RPC method name pairs.
///
/// Order doesn't matter for correctness, but is kept alphabetical by legacy
/// key for easier diffing against the frontend table.
