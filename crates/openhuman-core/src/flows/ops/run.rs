/// Instead this validates + compile-checks the flow synchronously (so a broken

/// `running` row, publishes `FlowRunStarted`, then spawns [`run_flow_body`] on a
/// background task and returns `{ run_id, status: "running", detached: true }`

/// `schemas::handle_run_detached`) — the UI "Run" control (canvas + Workflows
/// list) calls that entry point directly, and the trigger bus
/// (`flows::bus::spawn_run`) fires runs the same fire-and-forget way. Combined
