//! Which agent a flow belongs to, for the subscribers that act on a flow
//! named only by id in an event (`FlowScheduleTick`, `FlowRunFinished`).
//!
//! A flow saved from inside an agent's context lives in that agent's storage
//! scope (`crate::storage`). The subscribers run outside any agent, so they
//! look the flow up here and handle the event as its owner
//! (`crate::storage::agents::within_agent`); without a storage backend every
//! flow is `local` and this is a no-op.
