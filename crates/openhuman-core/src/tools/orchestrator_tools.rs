//! Dynamic orchestrator tool generation.
//!
//! The orchestrator agent is direct-first and only delegates specialised
//! work. Rather than exposing a single generic
//! `spawn_subagent(agent_id, prompt)` mega-tool, we synthesise one named
//! tool per [`SubagentEntry::AgentId`] in the orchestrator's
//! `[subagents] allowlist = [...]` TOML section, so the LLM's function-calling schema
//! contains discoverable, well-named tools like `manage_tasks`,
//! `create_image`, `build_workflow`, etc.
//!
//! For [`SubagentEntry::Skills`] wildcard expansions we synthesise one
//! `ToolExposure::Deferred` [`ComposioActionTool`] per action of every
//! connected Composio toolkit. Those never reach the wire: a belt that opted
//! into discovery (`tool_search` in its `[tools] named`) finds them through
//! the harness's `tool_search` bridge and calls them directly, so "send this
//! email" is one search and one call. There is no `delegate_to_integrations_
//! agent` any more — routing a single action through a sub-agent spawn cost a
//! blocking agentic round-trip and a second prompt for work the parent could
//! do in one call.
//!
//! Each synthesised delegation tool's description is pulled live from the
//! target agent's [`AgentDefinition::when_to_use`] — so descriptions
//! automatically stay in sync with the definitions and never drift from a
//! hardcoded table.
//!
//! Called from [`crate::agent::session_host::builder`] at
//! agent-build time, with the orchestrator's own definition, the global
//! registry (for delegation target lookups), and the current list of
//! connected Composio integrations.
//!
//! [`AgentDefinition::when_to_use`]: crate::agent::harness::definition::AgentDefinition::when_to_use
//! [`SubagentEntry::AgentId`]: crate::agent::harness::definition::SubagentEntry::AgentId
//! [`SubagentEntry::Skills`]: crate::agent::harness::definition::SubagentEntry::Skills
