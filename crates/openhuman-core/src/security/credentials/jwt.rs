//! Session JWT load and `Authorization` helpers for the TinyHumans API.
//!
//! The backend issues a bare JWT as the session token. These helpers *read*
//! it — they never verify it. The backend stays the authority on validity: a
//! token revoked before its `exp` still returns 401, and callers must handle
//! that. Reading `exp` locally is only an optimisation that avoids sending a
//! request with a token already known to be dead.
//!
//! Parsing is pure and has no backend dependency, which is why it lives in the
//! core rather than behind the backend transport: `security::credentials`
//! needs it on a core that has no TinyHumans connection at all.
//!
//! What stays OpenHuman-specific is *where the token lives*: the credentials
//! store, keyring, and auth-profile names below.
