//! Error type for the embedded typed facade.
//!
//! Every [`super::Core`] method returns [`CoreError`]. The variants exist to let
//! an embedding host (the Medulla TUI, a CLI, a test) tell four genuinely
//! different situations apart without parsing strings:
//!
//! - [`CoreError::Domain`] — the domain rejected the call and said why, via the
//!   [`StructuredRpcError`] envelope. Carries the stable `data.kind`
//!   discriminator and `expected_user_state`.
//! - [`CoreError::Unavailable`] — the method is not in this build at all,
//!   because a Cargo feature or a [`DomainSet`](openhuman_core::core::runtime::DomainSet)
//!   flag removed its controller. This is a *build fact*, not a failure.
//! - [`CoreError::Rpc`] — the call failed with a plain (unstructured) message.
//! - [`CoreError::Encode`] / [`CoreError::Decode`] — the facade's own
//!   serde boundary broke, which always means a facade bug, never a user error.
//!
//! The `Unavailable` split is the load-bearing one. `DomainSet` gates a domain
//! by *not registering its controllers* (`crates/openhuman-core/src/core/all.rs`), so a gated method
//! comes back as `unknown method: …` — indistinguishable from a typo unless the
//! facade classifies it. A host that cannot make that distinction renders a
//! scary red error where it should simply hide a tab.
