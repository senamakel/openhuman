# storage

The process's storage backend on the
[tinystoragedrivers](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinystoragedrivers)
ports, vendored through `vendor/tinyagents/vendor/tinystoragedrivers`.

One URL picks it: `OPENHUMAN_STORAGE_URL`, else `[storage] url` in
`config.toml` (`config::StorageConfig`), else the default,
`sqlite:<workspace_dir>` (`storage::config`).

The default installs no process-wide backend. The large relational stores
(`sessions.db`, `flows.db`, `jobs.db`, `graph_checkpoints.db`) keep serving
their own SQLite files as they always have, so nothing is migrated or
duplicated. The small stores (approvals, devices, notifications, task
sources) keep their rows as document tables inside their existing `.db` file
(`approval/approval.db`, `devices/devices.db`, `notifications/notifications.db`,
`task_sources/sources.db`): the first call in a process opens it with the
SQLite driver and `storage::local` imports the rows of the old tables, then
renames them to `_legacy_<name>` and keeps them for one release. The legacy
code paths stay for reading old data during that import, for builds without
`storage-sqlite`, for SaaS, and for the opt-out: `OPENHUMAN_STORAGE_URL=classic`
(or `[storage] url = "classic"`) keeps the pure legacy tables untouched.

| URL | Driver | Cargo feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory` | in-process, keeps nothing | always |
| `sqlite:<path>` (a `.db` file, or a directory with one file per database) | SQLite | `storage-sqlite` |
| `mongodb://…/<db>`, `mongodb+srv://…/<db>` | MongoDB, one database shared by every scope | `storage-mongodb` |
| `file:<dir>` | JSON and JSONL files | `storage-file` |

A URL for a driver the build lacks fails at `open`, naming the feature.
`storage-sqlite` is a default feature and in the shipped product; `file` is
always compiled in; `storage-mongodb` is in neither, a cloud build turns it
on.

## Entry points

- `configured_url(&Config)` / `url_from(env, &Config)`: the URL in effect.
- `open(url)`: parse and open a backend (credentials are redacted in logs).
- `install(backend)` / `installed()` / `clear()`: the process slot domains
  read the backend from.
- `scope_for_agent(agent_id)`: the storage scope an agent's records live
  under, the same mapping TinyAgents' `DriverSessionStores` uses, so every
  domain agrees.
- `driver_is_shared(driver)` / `installed_is_shared()`: whether other
  processes may write the same backend (MongoDB). Boot-time recovery, such
  as the orphaned-run sweep, is skipped on a shared backend.
- `driver_has_cross_process_cas(driver)`: whether a compare-and-swap on
  that driver is atomic across processes (MongoDB, SQLite), which a
  clustered node's leases need. Memory and file drivers coordinate only
  within one process.
- `fence` / `fenced_backend`: lease-epoch write fencing (see
  [Write fencing](#write-fencing)).
- `scope_for_profile(profile_id)`: the scope a SaaS profile's records live
  under (`profile:<id>`, hashed when that is not a valid scope).
- `current_scope()` / `current_scoped()`: the tenant's scope — its profile's
  when it serves one, else the acting agent's, else `local` on a single-user
  host; an error in SaaS mode without a profile — and the installed backend
  under it.
- `block_on(future)`: runs a storage future from synchronous store code on
  one shared runtime thread.
- `documents::Repo` and `documents::compare_and_swap`: the base the domain
  stores build on. A `Repo` holds one domain's scoped document handle,
  declares its collections and runs each call; `compare_and_swap` is the
  guarded-`UPDATE` loop.

## Leases

`storage::lease` gives one node exclusive, expiring ownership of a key; the
SaaS profile host uses it so exactly one core process serves a profile.
`LeaseStore` has four operations, each taking the caller's clock (`now_ms`)
so the rules never read the wall clock:

- `acquire(key, now_ms)` takes the key when it has no record, or its record
  is released, expired (`now_ms >= expires_at_ms`) or already this node's;
  otherwise `LeaseError::Held(record)` names the owner, its endpoint and
  (`retry_after_ms`) when to retry. Epochs start at 1 and every acquisition
  except a re-entrant one (the same store instance re-acquiring the epoch it
  holds) writes `epoch + 1`.
- `renew(grant, now_ms)` extends the grant by CAS on its record version; any
  write since (a takeover, a release) makes it `LeaseError::Lost`.
- `release(grant)` writes `released = true` under the same CAS and keeps the
  record.
- `holder(key)` returns the stored record, live or not (`is_live(now_ms)`).

A grant's `previous_unclean` is set exactly when the acquisition replaced a
record that was not released and that this store instance did not hold: a
foreign holder that expired, or this node's own id left by a crashed earlier
process. The profile host runs workspace recovery on it. Node ids must be
unique among live processes.

| Store | Where | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DocumentLeases` | one document per key, scope `cluster`, collection `leases`; every write carries `Precondition::Absent` or `Version` | clustered nodes on a driver with cross-process CAS |
| `LocalLeases` | an exclusive `fs2` flock on `<root>/<sha256(key) hex>/.lease`, record in `.lease.json` beside it; no expiry, the OS drops the lock when the process dies | hosts without a backend |

Keys are 1 to 200 bytes of ASCII letters, digits and `- _ . @`, not starting
with `.`, so they are safe as directory names and document ids. The scope
`cluster` is shared by every node; an agent whose id is literally `cluster`
would map to the same scope (`scope_for_agent`).

Tests: `lease_tests.rs` (the acquire rule), `lease_documents_tests.rs`
(contention, expiry, takeover, stale renew, clean release, and an
eight-thread race on a SQLite file with `--features storage-sqlite`),
`lease_local_tests.rs` (two instances on one root, crashed holder), and
`lease_model_tests.rs`, a proptest state machine of random acquire, renew,
release, clock and crash steps across 2 to 4 nodes checked against a
reference model.

## Write fencing

`storage::fence` and `storage::fenced_backend` fence writes by lease epoch.
Every backend `open` returns is a `FencedBackend`: its scoped handles look
the scope up in the process's `FenceRegistry` on each write (document `put`,
`delete`, `delete_where`, `claim`, `atomic_batch`, `drop_collection`; stream
`append`, `append_batch`, `truncate_before`, `delete_stream`; blob `put`,
`delete`). A scope with no fence passes through, so single-user hosts see no
change. A scope with one runs `LeaseFence::check` first:

1. the latch (set by the heartbeat on a lost lease, or by an earlier check);
2. the grant's expiry by this node's clock, less a skew margin (no I/O);
3. the stored lease record must still name this node at this epoch,
   unreleased and unexpired; a moved record latches the fence, an
   unreadable one refuses the write without latching.

A write the host check admits then goes to the driver through
`StorageBackend::for_scope_fenced` with `LeaseFence::driver_fence`: the lease
record (`cluster` scope, `leases` collection, id = the profile) must still
match `epoch`, `owner` = this node and `released = false`. The driver checks
it in the same statement or transaction as the write (tinystoragedrivers
v0.5.0, `Capability::Fencing`), so a holder paused between its check and
its write cannot land the write after a takeover. The driver answers
`ErrorKind::Fenced`, and the host re-reads the record, latches the fence
and returns `FenceError::Superseded`.

A refusal is a `StorageError` of kind `Backend` (not retryable, so CAS loops
do not spin) whose source is the typed `FenceError`; `fence::fence_error`
recovers it. The lookup is per write rather than per bound scope because
the session store caches its handles across a profile's open, fence and
re-open.

The write runs after the host check alone (and the paused-holder race stays
open) where the driver cannot fence it:

- a driver without `Capability::Fencing`: MongoDB without transactions (a
  standalone server);
- a write the driver answers `Unsupported(Fencing)`: MongoDB blob writes
  (GridFS cannot join a transaction);
- a named database (`StorageBackend::database`), which cannot see the lease
  records in the default database;
- a lease store with no record in the ports (`LocalLeases`).

Tests: `fence_tests.rs` (matching, local expiry, latch, record checks,
registry replace/retire/prune), `fenced_backend_tests.rs` (node A loses the
lease to node B by a clock advance: A's writes on every port are refused,
B's succeed; a paused node refuses its own writes inside the margin; named
databases; a fence over `LocalLeases`; and the paused-holder race on the
memory and SQLite drivers: A's check passes, B takes over, and the driver
refuses A's write, plus the fallbacks for named databases and drivers
without fencing).

## Consumers

- The SaaS profile host (`profiles::lease`, `profiles::registry`): one
  lease per profile (`DocumentLeases` over the installed backend, else
  `LocalLeases` under `<root>/users`) and the profile registry, collection
  `profiles` in the same `cluster` scope. A lease taken over unclean runs
  the profile's workspace recovery; a lost one fences the profile. See
  `profiles/README.md`. The server opens the operator's storage URL before
  boot (`openhuman-rpc`'s `session_store::install_for_saas`);
  `openhuman_embed::ProfileRuntime` opens and installs it itself when no
  backend is installed yet.
- The session store: `openhuman_rpc::session_store::install_for_host` opens
  the configured backend before boot and installs `DriverSessionStores`
  over it. See that module's README.
- Domain stores that switch to the document port when a backend is
  installed, each in a `store_documents.rs` beside its SQLite `store.rs`:
  approvals (`security::approval`), paired devices (`security::devices`),
  notifications (`desktop::notifications`) and task sources
  (`integrations::task_sources`).
- tinyflows' own stores on the ports (`tinyflows-drivers`), picked per call
  the same way: cron jobs and runs (`cron::store`, `CronDocuments`), the flow
  catalog and drafts (`flows::store`, `flows::draft_store`,
  `FlowCatalogDocuments`), per-flow engine state and dedup settlement
  (`flows::tinyflows::state::FlowState`), and the flow-run checkpointer
  (`DriverCheckpointer`). The delegation graph's checkpointer uses
  tinyagents-graph's `DriverCheckpointer`.
- `block_on_anyhow(future)`: `block_on` for those stores, whose errors are
  `anyhow::Error` (a typed `FlowUpdateError` passes through unchanged).
- Approvals (`security::approval`), through `store_documents.rs`.
- Secrets (`storage::secrets`): the keyring's user secrets
  (`security::keyring::get` / `set` / `delete`) and the credential stores'
  files (`auth-profiles.json`, `http-credentials.json`) become encrypted
  documents (`DocumentSecrets`, `enc2:`) in the acting agent's scope. Each
  scope's data key is derived with HKDF-SHA256 from the keyring master key
  (`OPENHUMAN_KEYRING_MASTER_KEY` / `_FILE`, else the OS keychain); with no
  master key they fail closed. The config encryption key stays on the
  process keyring, because `config.toml` is loaded before any agent acts.

## Background work and agent scopes

Work done inside an agent's turn runs under that agent's `CoreContext`
(`session_agent`, set for embed agents; a SaaS profile's context carries
`profile` instead, and its records land in the profile's scope), so with a
backend installed its records land in that agent's scope. Background work
runs under the process default context and on its own would only see
`local`. `storage::agents` closes the gap:

- Known agents: the live ones are `core::runtime::AgentContextRegistry`'s
  (embed registers each agent it builds and deregisters it on drop).
  `AgentContextRegistry::register` also records the agent id in the
  backend's `local` scope (`storage_agents`, `agents::record`), so a
  restarted process still knows it; `agents::contexts()` lists both.
- `for_each_scope(label, step)`: runs `step` for `local`, then under each
  known agent's context — its live one, or the default context acting for it
  (`CoreContext::for_agent`). `for_each_agent` skips `local`.
- `within_agent(agent, fut)` / `context_for(agent)`: re-enter an agent's
  scope when background work learned whose record it is handling.
- `find_owner(label, probe)`: the scope (`local` first, then each agent)
  where a record named only by id lives — for event subscribers, whose
  events carry ids but no agent.

Users: the task-source poller, the flows boot sweep and schedule-trigger reconcile, the run reaper,
the device tunnel (a paired device's frames run as the agent that paired
it, `security::devices::owner`), and the event subscribers: a flow's
schedule tick, run digest and dedup settlement run as the flow's owner
(`flows::bus::owner`); Composio app-event triggers and new connections are
matched in every scope; a cron job's completion notification is stored with
the job's owner. Without a backend these run once, as
before. The cron scheduler visits live agents only
(`cron::scheduler::tick_live_agents`): an agent's jobs need its live
context (host tools, prompt) to run, so a recorded agent's jobs wait until
it is live again; with a backend it no longer needs the agent's `jobs.db`. In SaaS mode agent ids are not recorded and `local` is skipped;
per-user background work there is `profiles::background`.

## Boundaries

The ports, drivers, scopes and conformance suites are tinystoragedrivers';
the session store over them is `tinyagents-session`. This domain only
resolves the URL, opens the backend, and holds it for the process. The
`[storage]` section is bootstrap configuration and is never read from
storage itself.
