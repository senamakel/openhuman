//! End-to-end proof that `Harness` runs a real agent turn as a library call.
//!
//! This is the acceptance test for the `openhuman_core::core::runtime`
//! composition (`CoreBuilder` + `DomainSet` + `ServiceSet::none()`): build with
//! no transport and no background services, run one turn, and assert nothing
//! was bound.
//!
//! # Why one test does all of it
//!
//! A `Harness` claims a process-wide slot, because the core's keyring, event bus
//! and `Once`-guarded subscribers are process-scoped. Splitting these assertions
//! into separate `#[test]` functions would either serialize them behind a mutex
//! (same thing, more code) or race. So the process builds exactly one harness
//! and checks everything against it.
//!
//! No live LLM call is made: `wiremock` stands in for the provider, which is
//! also what makes the routing assertion possible — if the turn had gone
//! anywhere else, the mock would have recorded no request.
