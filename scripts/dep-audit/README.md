# `scripts/dep-audit/` — Cargo dependency audit

Finds dependencies we can drop, unify, or slim across OpenHuman **and every
Cargo submodule under `vendor/`**, using
[`tinyanalyzer`](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinyanalyzer).

```bash
pnpm dep:audit                     # full sweep -> target/dep-audit/REPORT.md
pnpm dep:audit --snapshot          # ...and archive it as docs/dep-audit/<date>.md
pnpm dep:audit --targets '^(root|tinyagents)$' --top 25
```

A full sweep of 24 targets takes about 20 seconds; nothing is compiled, the
tool only runs `cargo metadata` and parses source.

The run avoids side effects on the tree: `cargo metadata` rewrites a
`Cargo.lock` that is stale relative to its manifest (`crates/openhuman-app`'s
lockfile in particular), or creates one where a target had none, so `run.sh`
records each target's lockfile state (present, with its exact contents, or
absent) before analyzing it and restores that state afterwards — restoring on
interruption too — printing which lockfiles it had to put back or remove. It
refuses to analyze a target whose `Cargo.lock` is a symlink rather than
backing up and writing through it. Refresh a lockfile deliberately (`cargo
update` / `cargo generate-lockfile`) if you want it refreshed.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `run.sh` | Discovers targets, runs `tinyanalyzer` once per target, then calls `report.mjs`. `--help` lists the flags. |
| `report.mjs` | Folds the per-target JSON into `REPORT.md` and `summary.json`. Re-runnable on its own: `node scripts/dep-audit/report.mjs --reports target/dep-audit`. |
| `tinyanalyzer.toml` | Shared analyzer config passed to every target (`--config`). Holds the `ignore_unused` list; see below before editing it. |
| `../../docs/dep-audit/<date>.md` | Committed snapshots from `--snapshot` runs, for diffing against the next run. |

## Prerequisites

- `tinyanalyzer` on `PATH` (`run.sh` prints the install one-liner if missing).
- Submodules checked out: `git submodule update --init --recursive vendor/`.
- Node 20+ (for `report.mjs`), `git`, `grep`.

## What gets analyzed

`run.sh` builds the target list itself, so a new submodule is picked up
automatically:

1. `root` — the OpenHuman workspace (`Cargo.toml` at the repo root).
2. `openhuman-app` — the Tauri host. It is `exclude`d from the root
   workspace and has its own `Cargo.lock`, so it is a separate graph.
3. Every entry of `git submodule status --recursive` that has a `Cargo.toml`,
   named after its directory (`tinyagents`, `tinybus`, `tinycortex`, …).

Nested checkouts (`vendor/tinymcp/vendor/tinybus`) are **skipped when a
checkout of the same repo at the same commit was already analyzed**, and
otherwise get a path-derived suffix (`tinybus@vendor_tinybox_vendor_tinybus`)
so both pins show up. A suffixed row in the report therefore *is* a finding:
that submodule pins a different commit of a shared dependency than its
siblings. `--keep-nested` analyzes every checkout regardless.

## Reading `REPORT.md`

### Targets

One row per target with its commit and headline counts. "Crates in graph" is
the `cargo metadata` resolve for every platform (no `--filter-platform`),
using each package's **default features** (tinyanalyzer does not pass
`--all-features`) — which is why Windows-only crates appear on a Linux run,
why a duplicate listed here may not show in `cargo tree` on your host, and
why a crate reachable only through a non-default optional feature will not
appear at all.

### 1. Declared dependencies no source file names

tinyanalyzer's check is textual: a dependency is "unused" if no `.rs` file in
the package mentions the crate. That misses crate names inside attributes
(`#[tokio::test]`, `#[derive(thiserror::Error)]`), so `report.mjs` re-checks
every flag with a grep over the package's own sources, **including
`[[test]]` / `[[example]]` targets declared by `path =` in its `Cargo.toml`**
(the root crate keeps its integration tests in `tests/` that way). Verdicts:

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **remove** | No `crate::…`, `use crate`, `#[crate…` or `crate!` anywhere. | Delete the line, `cargo check` (both feature-on and feature-off builds if it was `optional`), delete the `dep:` feature if one existed. |
| **remove** (name only) | The bare word occurs in a comment or string but never as a path. | Same as above; the mention is not a use. |
| keep (attribute/macro path) | Used through an attribute or macro body. | Nothing. Listed so the tool's false positives stay visible. |

**Graph win** is the number of crates that leave the target's build if that
one line is deleted. It is `0 (kept by …)` when another package in the same
workspace still depends on the crate: the manifest gets cleaner, the build
does not get smaller. Sort your effort by graph win.

`ignore_unused` in `tinyanalyzer.toml` is empty and should generally stay
that way: it hides a crate from tinyanalyzer's own unused check in *every*
target, so a genuinely unused occurrence in some other target goes
unreported too. `report.mjs`'s own re-check already covers the false
positive this list historically existed for (`#[derive(thiserror::Error)]`
with no `use thiserror`) by scanning for the attribute form and reporting
"keep" instead of "remove". Only add an entry here for a crate that is
provably unreachable through any `use`/path/attribute/macro form
tinyanalyzer or the re-check could ever see.

### 2. Crates resolved at more than one version

Each version is compiled and linked separately. **Only the `root` (and
`openhuman-app`) sections cost the shipped build**; submodule sections show
where a requirement should move so the root can unify. Within a `root` /
`openhuman-app` section, a duplicate reached only through a `development`
dependency (see section 1's Kind column) costs test/CI build time, not the
shipped binary — check the Kind before treating a row as production weight.

"Pulled in via" names the *direct* dependencies whose subtree carries that
version, walked from tinyanalyzer's edge list. `direct dep of <pkg>` means one
of our own packages declares it. To unify:

- If one version's "via" list is a single old crate we control (a submodule
  or a direct dep with a stale requirement), bump it.
- If the old version is only reachable through an *unused* direct dependency
  (section 1), removing that dependency removes the duplicate too.
- If both versions are reached through third-party crates we do not control,
  check whether one of them has a newer release; otherwise accept it.

`cargo tree -i <crate>@<version>` in that target gives the full chain.

### 3. Heaviest direct dependencies

Per target, the direct dependencies with the largest **exclusive** transitive
footprint — crates that would leave the build entirely if this one were
dropped. "Reaches" is the raw transitive count, most of which something else
pulls in anyway. "Source" is checked-out source size, not binary size. Unlike
section 1, this table excludes a dependency whose only edge kind is
`development` (test/example/benchmark-only): those are never linked into the
shipped binary, so they do not belong in a shipped-build weight ranking.

A high exclusive count usually means default features pulling in a subtree we
do not use. Try `default-features = false` plus the two or three features
needed, then re-run the audit and compare the row. `scripts/dep-sim.py` and
`scripts/assert-shed.sh` remain the tools for *proving* a reduction before
claiming it in a PR.

### 4. Version drift across repositories

Crates that two or more targets depend on directly but at
**semver-incompatible** versions (different major, or different minor for
`0.x`). Because the root workspace `[patch]`-es submodules in, every such row
becomes a duplicate in section 2 of `root`. Aligning the submodule's
requirement with the root's is usually a one-line change in that submodule
and removes a duplicate for free. Patch-level drift is counted but not
listed; cargo unifies it.

## Workflow for a clean-up pass

1. `pnpm dep:audit --snapshot` on a fresh branch.
2. Work section 1 by graph win, then section 4, then section 2's `root`
   rows. Submodule changes go to that submodule's own upstream as their own
   PR; bump the gitlink here afterwards (see the submodule PR conventions in
   `AGENTS.md`).
3. Re-run without `--snapshot` and diff `target/dep-audit/REPORT.md` against
   the committed snapshot. Commit a new snapshot with the clean-up PR.

## Extending

- `summary.json` next to `REPORT.md` has the same data as structured JSON
  (`targets[].unused`, `.duplicates`, `.heavy`, and top-level `drift`) for a
  future CI gate, e.g. failing on any new `remove` row with a graph win.
- Per-target `<name>.json` files are the raw tinyanalyzer reports and also
  carry file, complexity and dead-code findings that this report ignores.
  `tinyanalyzer vendor/<name>` opens the interactive dashboard over the same
  data.
