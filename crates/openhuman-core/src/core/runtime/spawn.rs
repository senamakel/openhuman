//! Spawning tasks without dropping who they work for.
//!
//! The ambient [`CoreContext`] and the memory identity are tokio task-locals,
//! so a bare `tokio::spawn` starts its task with neither: the child falls back
//! to the process default context and the root memory identity. In a
//! single-user process that default is the right user by accident. In a SaaS
//! process it is the operator, so a dropped scope writes one user's work
//! somewhere it does not belong — or, with the SaaS config redirect, fails.
//!
//! [`spawn_scoped`] captures both at the call site and re-enters them in the
//! child. New code in the core spawns through it; `scripts/ci/check-saas-ambient.mjs`
//! ratchets the bare spawns that remain.
