//! Host-registered agents the core's own schedulers can run.
//!
//! A library host (`openhuman-embed`) defines agents the core's registries
//! know nothing about: each carries its own [`AgentDefinition`], its own
//! in-process tools ([`HostTools`]) and its own derived [`CoreContext`]. Its
//! turns reach the harness directly, with all three in hand. The core's
//! *own* drivers -- the cron scheduler's agent jobs and a workflow's `agent`
//! node -- only have an agent **id**, and resolving an id through
//! `AgentDefinitionRegistry` or `config.agent_registry` finds either nothing
//! or a definition without the host's tools.
//!
//! This is the port that closes that gap. A host installs one
//! [`HostAgentResolver`]; a driver that is about to build a session for an id
//! asks it first ([`resolve`]) and, on a hit, builds the session from the
//! [`HostAgent`] it returns -- definition, host belt and config -- and runs
//! the turn inside [`HostAgent::scope`], so every ambient read (config loader,
//! DomainSet gate, tool groups, skill roots, session store) sees the host's
//! agent rather than the process default. A miss changes nothing: the driver
//! falls back to the registries exactly as before.
//!
//! Like the session store ([`crate::agent::session_store`]) the slot is
//! process-wide, because OpenHuman runs one runtime per process. The
//! installer keeps the `Arc` it installed and removes it with [`clear_if`],
//! which never removes a replacement someone else installed later.
//!
//! The driver keeps its own authority: a cron turn still runs under
//! `TrustedAutomation { Cron }` and a workflow node under its workflow
//! origin. Resolving an agent does not change who is asking.
