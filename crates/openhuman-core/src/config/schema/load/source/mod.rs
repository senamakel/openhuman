//! Where a config's TOML text lives: the [`ConfigSource`] port.
//!
//! The loader and `Config::save` work on TOML *text*; this port is the only
//! thing that knows where that text is kept, so the codec, the migrations, the
//! secret encryption and the corruption recovery are one code path for every
//! deployment.
//!
//! | Source | Where | Used |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`FileConfigSource`] | `config.toml`, replaced atomically (`atomic_commit`) with a `.bak` | desktop, CLI, and always at boot |
//! | [`DocumentConfigSource`] | the `config/{scope}` document on the storage backend | a shared (multi-tenant) backend, for saves and snapshot reloads |
//!
//! # Bootstrap config never comes from storage
//!
//! The `[storage]` table decides which backend exists, so it cannot be read
//! from one (and its URL can carry a database password). [`BOOTSTRAP_TABLES`]
//! are therefore stripped before a document is written and re-applied from the
//! file on every document read. A process boots before its backend is installed,
//! so its first load (`load_or_init`) normally reads the file; nothing
//! enforces that ordering.
//!
//! # Why text, not a JSON tree
//!
//! A document holds the TOML body as one string field. That is lossless
//! (a JSON tree would not round-trip every TOML value), keeps one parser, and
//! keeps the file hand-editable on desktop. The desktop file source keeps
//! `atomic_commit` and its `.bak`, `0600` and fsync guarantees, which the file
//! driver's blob API does not offer.
