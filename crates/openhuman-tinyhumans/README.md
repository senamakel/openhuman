# openhuman-tinyhumans

This crate connects an OpenHuman core to the hosted TinyHumans backend. The
core runs agents, memory, tools and RPC without any backend connection and
reaches the backend only through a port it defines. This crate implements that
port with the vendored `tinyhumans-sdk`, installs it into a process, and adds
the pieces that only make sense for a TinyHumans-connected product: the hosted
RPC proxies (billing, team, referral and so on), the host-side login and
session owner, and the Jev-backed `tool_search` ranker.

Every host that boots a core and wants the backend calls into this crate first:
the desktop shell ([`crates/openhuman-app`](../openhuman-app/)), the TUI ([`crates/openhuman-tui`](../openhuman-tui/)),
the CLI binary ([`crates/openhuman-cli`](../openhuman-cli/)) and the integration-test fixtures.
Library products build through its `RuntimeBuilder`.

## How it works

### Where it sits

```text
  openhuman-app    openhuman-tui    openhuman-cli    library products
        |                |                |                 |
        +----------------+-------+--------+-----------------+
                                 |  install() or RuntimeBuilder
                                 v
  +------------------------------------------------+
  |              openhuman-tinyhumans              |
  |  transport/  backend/  hosted/  session/  jev/ |
  +------------------------------------------------+
           |                               |
           v                               v
    openhuman-embed               vendor/tinyhumans-sdk
  (Runtime -> Agent facade)       (HTTP, route registry,
           |                       auth header shapes)
           v
    openhuman-core
  (BackendTransport port, controller registry)
```

The core has no `tinyhumans-sdk` dependency, and `cargo tree -p openhuman -i
tinyhumans-sdk` must stay empty. This is the only crate in the tree allowed to
depend on the SDK. A core with no transport installed still works; every
backend-touching call (billing, `/agent-integrations/*` tools, channel relay,
cloud voice) answers with `BackendApiError::BackendUnavailable`, which the RPC
layer renders as a `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:` error that observability demotes.

The crate's only openhuman dependency is `openhuman-embed`, per the chain
core -> embed -> tinyhumans -> rpc -> hosts. The public embed API covers the transport port
(`BackendTransport`, `install_backend_transport`, ...) and the seam types
(`embed::seams::{ControllerExtension, ...}`; the ranker trait is `tinytools::ToolRanker`, taken from the same vendored path); the deeper core
internals the transport and hosted controllers need (`backend::BackendClient`,
`core::all`'s registry types, `security::credentials`, `config`) come through
embed's `#[doc(hidden)] __host` module, an explicit list kept in embed.

### Installing into a process

`install(InstallOptions)` in [`src/install.rs`](src/install.rs) is the compatibility entry point
for hosts that still boot the core themselves. It resolves the same `Wiring`
(`install::wiring`) the builder uses and applies it to the process globals.
It does four things, in this order:

1. If `InstallOptions::product_identity` is set, it stores the new
   `ProductIdentity` (the `x-sdk-name` header value) and drops any transport it
   built earlier, because the transport captures attribution headers when it
   is constructed.
2. If `hosted_controllers` is true (the default), it registers
   `hosted::extension()` with the core through
   `core::all::register_controller_extension`. The core treats an identical
   re-registration as a no-op.
3. With the `jev` feature and `tool_ranker` true (the default), it installs a
   `jev::TinyHumansJevRanker` as the process-wide `tool_search` ranker,
   replacing the previous one in place.
4. It builds one `SdkBackendTransport` and installs it with
   `openhuman_embed::install_backend_transport`. On a later
   call it reuses the transport it already built, re-installing it into the
   core slot if something cleared it (tests do this).

`install` returns the `Arc<SdkBackendTransport>` so a host that also uses
`CoreBuilder` can bind it explicitly with `CoreBuilder::backend_transport`.
Binding is optional: the core resolves the process-global transport when a
context carries none. `is_installed()` reports whether this crate's transport
is still the core's global one.

```rust
openhuman_tinyhumans::install(openhuman_tinyhumans::InstallOptions::default())?;
```

The CLI does this in [`crates/openhuman-cli/src/main.rs`](../openhuman-cli/src/main.rs) before
`run_core_from_args`; in-process test suites do it through
[`tests/support/tinyhumans_boot.rs`](../../tests/support/tinyhumans_boot.rs).

### The configuration path: RuntimeBuilder

`RuntimeBuilder` in [`src/runtime.rs`](src/runtime.rs) wraps `openhuman_embed::RuntimeBuilder`.
It starts from `new()`, a host preset (`library()`, `desktop()`, `cli()`,
`tui()`) or `from_embed()`, and forwards every embed knob unchanged
(`workspace`, `workspace_dir`, `action_dir`, `config_source`, `token`,
`listen`, `api_key`, `backend_url`, `provider`, `access`, `services`,
`domains`, `tool_groups`, `host_kind`, `session`, `config`, `session_store`,
`memory_engine`) and every seam option (`controller_extension`, `tool_ranker`,
`post_turn_hook`, `tool_hook`, `server_launcher`, `live_policy`). It adds
`product_identity`, `hosted_controllers` and `jev_ranker`, which feed
`InstallOptions`.

`connect()` returns the embed builder with the TinyHumans connection applied
through embed's own options: the product identity is set, the SDK transport
is installed as the process global and bound with `backend_transport`, the
hosted proxies go in with `controller_extension`, and the Jev ranker with
`tool_ranker` (restored when the runtime drops). A host `tool_ranker` replaces
the Jev one, however it was set. `build()` is `connect()` then boot; `run_from_args()` is
`connect()` then the embed CLI dispatcher. `into_embed()` drops back to the
plain embed builder with no backend connection.

```rust
use openhuman_tinyhumans::{embed::Workspace, RuntimeBuilder};

let runtime = RuntimeBuilder::new()
    .workspace(Workspace::Ephemeral)
    .api_key("th_...")
    .build()
    .await?;
```

See [`gitbooks/developing/tinyhumans-api-key.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/tinyhumans-api-key.md)
for what one TinyHumans API key unlocks across inference, search, embeddings,
media, integrations, voice and Jev.

### A backend request, end to end

When a core domain calls the backend (for example through
`BackendClient::authed_json` or the integrations client), the request reaches
this crate as a `BackendRequest`:

```text
 core domain
   |  BackendRequest { method, path, base_url, credential, profile, ... }
   v
 SdkBackendTransport::send_json            (src/transport/mod.rs)
   |  pick reqwest::Client for profile (Api 120 s, Integrations 60 s)
   |  TinyHumansClient::new(base_url)
   |    .with_http_client(..) .with_default_headers(x-sdk-name)
   |    .with_token(jwt)  or  .with_api_key(key)
   v
 tinyhumans_sdk raw().send(..)             (route policy, envelope unwrap)
   |
   +-- Ok(Value) ------------------------------------------> core
   +-- Err(tinyhumans_sdk::Error) -> map_sdk_error -> BackendTransportError
```

The transport also answers the core's non-request questions: `base_url`
(control-plane or inference base, from `backend::url`), `product_identity`,
`attribution_headers` and `http_client`. The core holds no hosted URL, header
policy or product identity of its own; it asks the installed transport.

## Layout

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`src/lib.rs`](src/lib.rs) | Crate root: module declarations and the public re-exports (`install`, `RuntimeBuilder`, the session types, `SdkBackendTransport`, `ProductIdentity`). Its `embed` module is a curated `pub use` list of the embed items rpc, the hosts and library users take (not the crate); it forwards embed's `#[doc(hidden)] __host` to rpc only. |
| [`src/install.rs`](src/install.rs) | `install`, `is_installed`, `InstallOptions`, `InstallError`. Process-global, idempotent. |
| [`src/runtime.rs`](src/runtime.rs) | `RuntimeBuilder` and `RuntimeError`: an embed builder that installs the transport on `build()`. |
| [`src/backend/`](src/backend/README.md) | Where the backend is (`url.rs`), how requests are attributed (`headers.rs`), and who they are attributed to (`product.rs`). |
| [`src/transport/`](src/transport/README.md) | `SdkBackendTransport`, the `BackendTransport` implementation, and `map_sdk_error`. |
| [`src/hosted/`](src/hosted/README.md) | The hosted-backend RPC proxies: `billing`, `team`, `referral`, `announcements`, `webhooks`, `channel_link`, `oauth`. |
| [`src/session/`](src/session/README.md) | The host-side login and session owner: `SessionManager`, `SessionClient`, `CurrentUserCache`, `CoreLink`. |
| [`src/jev/`](src/jev/README.md) | The Jev-backed `tool_search` ranker (behind the `jev` feature). |
| [`src/jwt.rs`](src/jwt.rs) | Re-exports the SDK's JWT readers (`bearer_authorization_value`, `decode_jwt_exp_unix`, `decode_jwt_payload`) for hosts that already depend on this crate. |

## Key types and entry points

- `install` / `InstallOptions` (`src/install.rs`): connect a core booted by any
  host. Builder methods `product_identity`, `hosted_controllers` and
  `tool_ranker` adjust the defaults.
- `RuntimeBuilder` (`src/runtime.rs`): boot an embed runtime that is already
  connected.
- `SdkBackendTransport` ([`src/transport/mod.rs`](src/transport/mod.rs)): the transport itself, with
  `new()` and `shared()` for hosts that want to install it by hand.
- `hosted_controllers` (re-export of `hosted::extension`): the hosted RPC
  surface as one `ControllerExtension`, for hosts that register it themselves.
- `SessionManager<L: CoreLink>` ([`src/session/manager.rs`](src/session/manager.rs)): what the desktop
  shell and the TUI drive for login, logout and the current user.
- `set_product_identity` / `ProductIdentity` ([`src/backend/product.rs`](src/backend/product.rs)): set the
  `x-sdk-name` a product reports, once, before any backend traffic.

## RPC surface

`install` registers the hosted controllers under `DomainGroup::Hosted`. Wire
names are `openhuman.<namespace>_<function>`:

| Namespace | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| `billing` | `get_summary`, `get_current_plan`, `get_balance`, `purchase_plan`, `create_portal_session`, `top_up`, `create_coinbase_charge`, `get_transactions`, `get_auto_recharge`, `update_auto_recharge`, `get_cards`, `create_setup_intent`, `update_card`, `delete_card`, `redeem_coupon`, `get_coupons` |
| `team` | `get_usage`, `list_members`, `list_teams`, `get_team`, `create_team`, `update_team`, `delete_team`, `switch_team`, `leave_team`, `join_team`, `create_invite`, `remove_member`, `change_member_role`, `list_invites`, `revoke_invite` |
| `referral` | `get_stats`, `claim` |
| `announcements` | `get_latest` |
| `webhooks` | `list_tunnels`, `create_tunnel`, `get_tunnel`, `update_tunnel`, `delete_tunnel`, `get_bandwidth` (shared namespace) |
| `auth` | `create_channel_link_token`, `oauth_connect`, `oauth_list_integrations`, `oauth_fetch_integration_tokens`, `oauth_revoke_integration`, `oauth_fetch_client_key` (shared namespace) |
| `channels` | `telegram_login_start`, `telegram_login_check`, `discord_link_start`, `discord_link_check` (shared namespace) |

The `webhooks`, `auth` and `channels` namespaces also hold core controllers;
the core keeps describing them. See [`src/hosted/README.md`](src/hosted/README.md)
for the per-domain detail.

## Features

The crate forwards every core gate 1:1 to `openhuman-embed`, which forwards it
to the core (`http-server`, `inference`, `voice`, `web3`, `channels`, and the
rest). Its one gate of its own is `jev`, on by default: it compiles in
`tinytools-jev` and `tinyjevclient` and the `jev` module. The desktop shell
enables it explicitly (`features = ["jev"]`) because it builds this crate with
`default-features = false`. Without `jev` the harness ranks `tool_search` with
BM25 alone. [`scripts/ci/check-feature-forwarding.mjs`](../../scripts/ci/check-feature-forwarding.mjs) checks the forwarding
chain core, embed, tinyhumans, cli.

## Boundaries

- The core owns the port (`BackendTransport`, `BackendRequest`,
  `BackendTransportError` in [`crates/openhuman-core/src/backend/transport/`](../openhuman-core/src/backend/transport/)),
  the authenticated JSON client (`backend/client.rs`), credential resolution
  (`security::credentials::session_support::resolve_backend_credential`) and
  all recovery from errors. This crate decides what a backend response means;
  the core decides what to do about it.
- Route implementations belong in the vendored SDK (`tinyhumansai/tinyhumans-sdk`,
  [`vendor/tinyhumans-sdk`](../../vendor/tinyhumans-sdk/)). Its unexposed-route registry is the route policy
  the transport enforces. The transport never adds a route the core does not
  already name. Two team routes the SDK does not carry (`POST /teams`,
  `DELETE /teams/{id}`) stay on the core's `BackendClient::authed_json` until
  the SDK gains them.
- The core never obtains, validates, exchanges or refreshes a credential. It
  takes one through `auth.set_credential`. Login-token exchange, `GET
  /auth/me` and the current-user cache live in `session/` here.
- Hosted memory does not ride this transport. The core's `memory/engine.rs`
  hands TinyMemory's own HTTP client an endpoint from `backend::base_url`,
  the attribution headers from `backend::attribution_headers` and a bearer
  source, so memory needs the transport installed for its URL and headers,
  but `/memory/*` requests never pass through `SdkBackendTransport` and the
  SDK route registry does not apply to them.
- Realtime Socket.IO stays on the core's own `platform::socket` transport; the
  SDK is built with `default-features = false`, which drops its socket client.
- The generic Jev types (`JevRanker`, `JevEvaluator`, `JevStrategy`) live in
  [`vendor/tinyagents/vendor/tinytools/crates/tinytools-jev`](../../vendor/tinyagents/vendor/tinytools/crates/tinytools-jev/)
  (`tinyhumansai/tinytools`). This crate owns only the wire and credential.

## Gotchas

- Set the product identity before the transport is built. `install` handles
  ordering for you if you pass it in `InstallOptions`; calling
  `set_product_identity` after `install` updates `attribution_headers()` (built
  fresh per call) but not the default headers baked into the already-built
  `reqwest::Client`s.
- `install` must run before the first backend-touching dispatch. A suite that
  boots the core in-process and forgets it sees `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:` from
  every backend call. Suites that spawn the `openhuman-core` binary get it from
  `main.rs`.
- `InstallOptions::hosted_controllers(false)` keeps the proxies out of the
  registry entirely. Leaving it on with a `DomainSet` that excludes `hosted`
  also works: the group gate hides them.

## Tests

Tests sit beside their modules as `*_tests.rs` files. `transport_tests.rs` pins
the wire shape the core's classifiers depend on (bearer versus `x-api-key`,
attribution headers, `Status` and `Envelope` mapping, SDK route refusal)
against a wiremock backend, and `channel_404_tests.rs` pins the
channel-message 404 split. The hosted domains test against wiremock with
`hosted/test_support.rs`; `session/*_tests.rs` drive the login owner against
an in-process axum stub backend and a stub `CoreLink` from
`session/test_support.rs`.

```bash
cargo test -p openhuman-tinyhumans
cargo test -p openhuman-tinyhumans session::
pnpm debug rust openhuman_tinyhumans
```
