//! Issues #6952 and #6990: one requirements check before a root orchestrator
//! turn's first final answer stands.
//!
//! The mechanism is the generic
//! [`VerifyBeforeFinishMiddleware`](tinyagents_harness::middleware::VerifyBeforeFinishMiddleware)
//! from tinyagents. This module owns only OpenHuman's policy: which turns get
//! it, what counts as a multi-step task, and the check text.
//!
//! This is an experimental model-quality lever (a hypothesis to A/B on the
//! bench). On Terminal-Bench 4.0 every failure ended voluntarily, inside its
//! budget, after the model's own checks passed without ever testing the
//! deliverable against what the task stated.

const CHECK_INSTRUCTION: &str = "Before finishing: re-read the original request and check \
the final result against it.\n\
1. Split the task statement into individual requirements. Include every constraint, \
prohibited case, expected output or error, threshold, and case in parentheses.\n\
2. For each requirement, name and perform an independent check using the exact examples, \
inputs and conditions stated in the request. Verify the complete outcome, including \
expected errors and side effects, and cite evidence from the final environment. Checks \
count only if derived from the request, not from your own approach.\n\
3. Where a sentence allows two readings, examine both against the surrounding requirements. \
Apply the literal rule where it resolves the ambiguity; where both readings can be satisfied \
at once, make the result satisfy both and test each. Where they cannot (one path called a \
folder and a file), let the evidence decide in this order: the request's own test, verifier \
or example call; the form of the value it shows (a value with a file extension is being used \
as a file); the prose label last. Otherwise check both readings and state any remaining \
uncertainty instead of treating a check of your guess as proof.\n\
4. Find equivalent paths or workflows that perform the same action and verify that their \
required outcomes, notifications and state changes are consistent.\n\
5. Where the result will face inputs you have not seen (a hidden test set, \"all\" or \"any\" \
inputs, other files of the same kind), build several fresh inputs that differ from the \
example in the ways the request allows, adversarial ones for anything that filters or \
validates, and run them. Where an oracle, reference tool or ground truth is available, \
check every part of the result against it, not a sample. A property you never varied is \
one you have not checked, so do not record it as verified.\n\
6. Run the final check through the exact interface the request names, from the state as it \
will be judged: the exact path, file name, command line, port or format, and the exact \
allowed or forbidden elements where a list is given. A check through a copied helper, a \
scratch launcher, a different entry point or a metric of your own is a debugging signal, \
not proof. Where the request states a number or a reference to meet, measure against that \
and state the measured value. Once every check the contract names passes, the named tests, \
verifier script or reference tool included, that state is the result: stop exploring and \
stop polishing. One passing check through the real interface is not the whole contract; a \
named test still failing or never run means you are not done.\n\
7. Leave the result as requested, not as your checks left it: remove what your checks \
created that the request did not ask for (build outputs, compiled binaries, scratch and \
test files), especially next to the deliverable, then confirm that what remains is exactly \
what was asked for, no more. The same for actions: an irreversible change the request did \
not ask for (rewriting history, deleting or resetting data, changing settings) is not an \
improvement; if you believe one is warranted, say so in your answer instead of making it.\n\n\
Fix anything that fails and re-run the affected checks. If all holds, give your final \
answer in full, since it replaces your previous reply.";
