//! Give an in-process core its TinyHumans backend transport.
//!
//! The core carries no backend client. Suites that spawn the
//! `openhuman-core` binary get the transport from `main.rs`
//! (`openhuman_rpc::host::cli`); suites that boot
//! the core in-process (`build_core_http_router`, direct `ops` calls against
//! the mock backend) must call [`boot`] first or every backend-touching call
//! answers `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:`. Idempotent and cheap: call it from any
//! fixture, as often as you like.
//!
//! Include with `#[path = "support/tinyhumans_boot.rs"] mod tinyhumans_boot;`
//! (or `../support/...` from `tests/raw_coverage/`).
