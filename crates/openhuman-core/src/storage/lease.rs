//! Exclusive, expiring ownership of a named key: the lease.
//!
//! A lease says which node owns a key (in SaaS mode: which core process
//! serves a profile) and until when. Two implementations share the
//! [`LeaseStore`] contract:
//!
//! - [`DocumentLeases`] keeps one record per key in the document port
//!   (scope [`CLUSTER_SCOPE`], collection [`LEASE_COLLECTION`]) and moves it
//!   only by compare-and-swap, so it is correct across processes on a driver
//!   with cross-process CAS ([`super::driver_has_cross_process_cas`]).
//! - [`LocalLeases`] is for hosts without a backend: an exclusive `flock` on
//!   `<root>/<sha256(key) hex>/.lease`, which the OS drops when the holder dies.
//!
//! No wall clock is read here: every operation takes `now_ms`, so behaviour
//! is a function of its inputs and the tests are deterministic.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! - **acquire** takes the key when it has no record, its record is
//!   released, expired (`now_ms >= expires_at_ms`), or already this node's.
//!   Otherwise it fails with [`LeaseError::Held`] carrying the live record.
//!   A fresh key starts at epoch 1; every acquisition other than a
//!   re-entrant one (this same store instance already holds that epoch)
//!   writes `epoch + 1`, so epochs only grow. An expired takeover does not
//!   stop the previous holder: resources a lease protects must reject writes
//!   carrying an epoch below the current one, and a holder must stop work
//!   before `expires_at_ms` minus the maximum clock skew between nodes (each
//!   node supplies its own `now_ms`). Nothing in this module checks epochs at
//!   the protected resource. An epoch at `u64::MAX` cannot be advanced, so a
//!   takeover of it fails with a storage error instead of repeating it.
//! - **renew** extends a grant by compare-and-swap on the version it holds.
//!   Any write since (a takeover, a release) makes it [`LeaseError::Lost`].
//! - **release** marks the record `released = true` under the same CAS and
//!   keeps it, so the next acquirer can tell a clean hand-over from a crash.
//!
//! # `previous_unclean`
//!
//! A grant's `previous_unclean` is `true` exactly when the acquisition
//! replaced a record that was **not released** and that this store instance
//! did not itself hold. That covers a different owner whose lease expired
//! (it stopped renewing: crashed, partitioned or hung) and this node's own
//! id left over from an earlier process (it crashed before releasing). A
//! fresh key, a released record and a re-entrant acquire are clean. The
//! profile host runs workspace recovery when it is set.
//!
//! Node ids must be unique among live processes: a record carrying this
//! node's id but not held by this instance is treated as a dead previous
//! incarnation and taken over at once.
