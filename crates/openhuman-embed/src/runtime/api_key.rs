//! The TinyHumans API key — the one credential a library runtime holds.
//!
//! Library mode has no user login. The key is installed into the runtime's
//! own credential store (beside its `config.toml`, never in it) before the
//! core boots, and from then on every managed-backend call authenticates
//! with it: managed inference as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, SDK REST
//! routes as `x-api-key`. See `openhuman_core::security::credentials::api_key`
//! for the core side.
