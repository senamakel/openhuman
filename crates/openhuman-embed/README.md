# openhuman-embed

`openhuman-embed` is the library crate a product depends on to run the
OpenHuman core inside its own process. It turns the core's JSON controllers
and ambient task-locals into ordinary Rust types: build one `Runtime`, put any
number of `Agent`s on it, and run turns that return a typed `TurnOutcome`.
OpenCompany and other embedding products use it directly, and
`openhuman-tinyhumans` wraps it to add the hosted TinyHumans backend. The
narrative walkthrough is
[`gitbooks/developing/embedding.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/embedding.md).

## How it works

The crate has two entry points, and they sit at different heights over the
core.

```text
   host product
        |
        |  Runtime::builder() ... build()        Core::from_runtime(rt)
        v                                              |
  +-----------+   agent(spec)   +---------+            |
  |  Runtime  | --------------> |  Agent  | (n per     |
  +-----------+                 +---------+  runtime)  |
        |                            |                 |
        | CoreBuilder::build         | Turn::send      | Config / Auth /
        v                            v                 | CoreAgent
  +----------------------------------------------+     |
  | openhuman-core (package `openhuman`)          | <---+
  |  CoreRuntime, CoreContext, controller registry|
  +----------------------------------------------+
```

The library API is `Runtime` then `Agent`. `RuntimeBuilder::build` claims the
process slot, resolves a workspace on disk, assembles one base `Config`,
writes the TinyHumans API key into the credential store (when given), and
hands everything to the core's `CoreBuilder`. The result is one booted
`CoreRuntime` wrapped in a `Runtime`.

`Runtime::agent(spec)` then turns an `AgentSpec` into an `Agent`. Nothing runs
and no RPC is made. `agent::build::instantiate` validates the id, clones the
runtime's base config, and applies the spec on top in a fixed order: access,
provider model, MCP servers, Composio credential, memory binding, then the
`config` escape hatch. It creates the agent's directories, copies its skills,
builds its `AgentDefinition`, checks that the agent only narrows the runtime's
`DomainSet` and `ToolGroups`, and finally derives a per-agent `CoreContext`
with `CoreContext::derive_with`.

A turn on that agent goes through `Turn::send`:

```text
 agent.turn("msg").session(id).send()
   |
   |- mint a session id ("embed-<uuid>") if none was given
   |- refuse a half route, or a bearer sent to a non-https endpoint
   |- enter the origin and progress task-local scopes, if set
   |- runtime.run_in(agent ctx, ...)
   |     agent_chat_for(config, AgentChatTarget::Definition { .. }, ...)
   |       (inference::host_runtime::ops, native, no JSON)
   v
 TurnOutcome { reply, session_id, usage }
```

Because the turn runs under the agent's own context, the core's config
loader, `DomainSet` gate, tool-group filter and skill discovery all read that
agent's settings. Two agents on one runtime never see each other's provider,
access tier, MCP servers or skills. Conversations are keyed by thread id and
agent id, so a turn only resumes its own agent's thread.

The second entry point is `Core`, for a host that built a `CoreRuntime` with
`CoreBuilder` itself. `Core::from_runtime` wraps it and exposes typed
sub-facades (`config()`, `auth()`, `agent()`). These go through
`CoreRuntime::invoke` (the private `call` helper in [`src/call.rs`](src/call.rs)), so they
honour `DomainSet` gating and absorb the variable `{result, logs}` envelope
that controllers emit. `CoreAgent` runs the runtime's orchestrator over the
`inference.agent_chat` RPC. `Core::raw()` is the escape hatch for a call the
facade does not model yet; a raw call that keeps coming back is a candidate
for a typed method here.

## Using it

Add the dependency with the default contributor features, or pick a narrow
host build:

```toml
[dependencies]
openhuman-embed = { git = "https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman", package = "openhuman-embed" }

# or
openhuman-embed = { git = "https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman", package = "openhuman-embed", default-features = false, features = ["inference", "mcp"] }
```

### A runtime and several agents

For hosted TinyHumans inference and services, build the runtime with
[`openhuman_tinyhumans::RuntimeBuilder`](../openhuman-tinyhumans/README.md).
It mirrors this crate's builder and installs the SDK-backed backend transport
on `build()`. The plain `openhuman_embed::RuntimeBuilder` suits standalone
hosts that bring their own providers.

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_tinyhumans::{
    embed::{Access, AgentSpec, McpServer, Provider, Workspace},
    RuntimeBuilder,
};

# async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let runtime = RuntimeBuilder::new()
    .workspace(Workspace::dir("/var/lib/my-product/openhuman"))
    .api_key("th_live_...")                   // the only credential in library mode
    .build()
    .await?;

let reviewer = runtime.agent(
    AgentSpec::new("reviewer")
        .system_prompt("You review pull requests and never edit files.")
        .access(Access::readonly())
        .skills_dir("./skills/review")        // copied into this agent's skills root
        .action_dir("/srv/checkouts/pr-42"),
)?;

let fixer = runtime.agent(
    AgentSpec::new("fixer")
        .provider(Provider::openai_compatible("https://api.example/v1", "sk-...").model("gpt-5"))
        .access(Access::full())
        .mcp(McpServer::stdio("github", "gh-mcp", ["stdio"]))
        .action_dir("/srv/checkouts/pr-42"),
)?;

let review = reviewer.run("Summarise the risks in this change.").await?;
let fix = fixer
    .turn(format!("Address these findings:\n{}", review.reply))
    .send()
    .await?;

// Continue the same conversation with the same agent.
let again = fixer.turn("Now run the tests.").session(&fix.session_id).send().await?;
println!("{}", again.reply);
# Ok(())
# }
```

`McpServer` and `AgentSpec::mcp` need the `mcp` feature; `skills_dir` needs
`skills`. `Agent::run` always starts a new conversation. To continue one, pass
the returned `session_id` to `Turn::session`.

A `Turn` has more knobs than the example shows: `model` and `temperature`
for one turn, `cwd` to root the file and shell tools somewhere else (use
`openhuman_embed::absolute` for a relative path, since the core resolves a
relative `cwd` against `action_dir`), `route` for a one-off endpoint,
`origin` for the authority the turn claims, `on_progress` for live
`AgentProgress` events, `meter` for usage that is reported even when the turn
fails, and `seed` to replace the session's history with rows the host
supplies.

### Harness: the one-agent shorthand

`Harness` is a `Runtime` plus exactly one `Agent` with the id `harness`,
built from one set of inputs. `harness.runtime()` and `harness.agent()` hand
out the two halves, so a host that outgrows one agent adds more on the same
runtime instead of building a second harness.

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_embed::{Access, Harness, Provider, Workspace};

# async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let harness = Harness::builder()
    .provider(Provider::openai_compatible("https://api.example/v1", "sk-...").model("gpt-5"))
    .workspace(Workspace::Ephemeral)
    .access(Access::readonly())
    .build()
    .await?;

let first = harness.run("Summarize what you can see.").await?;
let second = harness
    .turn("Now list the risks.")
    .session(&first.session_id)
    .send()
    .await?;
println!("{}", second.reply);
# Ok(())
# }
```

A harness keeps a few older defaults. Its agent's `action_dir` is the
workspace's own `action/` directory, its skills are copied into the shared
`<workspace>/skills` root, and it only turns on the `mcp` and `skills` domain
families when servers or a skills directory were supplied. See
[`src/harness/README.md`](src/harness/README.md).

### The typed core facade

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;

use openhuman_embed::{Core, CoreBuilder, DomainSet, HostKind, ServiceSet};

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let runtime = CoreBuilder::new(HostKind::Library)
    .domains(DomainSet::embedded())
    .services(ServiceSet::none())
    .build()
    .await?;
let core = Core::from_runtime(Arc::new(runtime));
let flags = core.config().runtime_flags().await?;
println!("log_prompts={}", flags.log_prompts);
# Ok(())
# }
```

`Core::agent()` needs the `inference` domain family at runtime. Note that
`DomainSet::harness()` leaves `inference` off despite its name; use
`DomainSet::embedded()`.

### Product identity

An embedding product sets its identity once at startup, before any backend
client is built. It becomes the `x-sdk-name` header on TinyHumans requests.

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_tinyhumans::{set_product_identity, ProductIdentity};

if let Some(identity) = ProductIdentity::new("opencompany") {
    set_product_identity(identity);
}
```

`openhuman_tinyhumans::RuntimeBuilder::product_identity` does the same as
part of the build.

## What the runtime owns and what an agent owns

The runtime owns everything that is process-scoped in the core: the
workspace and credential store, the event bus, the keyring, the RPC bearer,
the background `ServiceSet`, the registered `DomainSet` and the API key.
Agents can only narrow the domain set, so a runtime has to register `mcp` and
`skills` if any agent will use them. The default runtime does when those
features are compiled in.

Each agent owns its provider route and model, its access tier and turn
origin, its `action_dir`, its MCP servers, its skills root, its
`AgentDefinitionSpec` (system prompt, tool scope, sandbox mode, iteration cap,
temperature), its narrowed `DomainSet` and `ToolGroups`, its memory binding
and an optional host tool factory.

The on-disk layout under a runtime-owned root:

```text
<root>/
  config.toml, auth-profiles.json, core.token     runtime-wide
  workspace/
    session_db/sessions.db                        runtime-wide run ledger
    agents/<id>/session_raw/                      each agent's transcripts
    agents/<id>/skills/, workflows/               each agent's skills roots
    agents/<id>/cron/jobs.db                      each agent's cron jobs
  agents/<id>/action/                             default action_dir per agent
```

The default `action_dir` sits beside the workspace, never inside it, because
the core refuses agent writes beneath the workspace. An inherited workspace
uses `<action_dir>/agents/<id>` instead.

### Per agent

Every agent on a runtime is isolated from its siblings on the same workspace:

- Policy and approvals: the autonomy tier, `auto_approve`, `auto_approve_all`
  and the approval gate switch come from the agent's `Access`
  (`auto_approve`, `auto_approve_all`, `approval_gate`). Parked approvals
  carry the agent id; `Agent::approvals()` lists and decides only that
  agent's requests, and a chat reply routes by agent and thread.
- Sub-agents: `AgentSpec::subagents` declares workers only that agent can
  delegate to. Built-in ids (`orchestrator`, `planner`, …) are reserved.
  Detached sub-agents keep the agent's provider route.
- MCP: each agent has its own MCP host and dynamic registry under
  `<workspace>/agents/<id>/`, plus the servers its spec declares.
- Transcripts: `<workspace>/agents/<id>/session_raw/`. Conversations written
  before this layout into `<workspace>/session_raw/` stay readable and are
  copied into the agent's directory when resumed; the shared file is never
  changed.
- Skills: `install_skill` and `create_skill` write user-scope bundles into
  `<workspace>/agents/<id>/skills/` and `workflows/`, which only that agent
  discovers. The operator's `~/.openhuman` is untouched.
- Cron: jobs an agent creates live in `<workspace>/agents/<id>/cron/jobs.db`
  and run under that agent's context, provider and policy.
- Memory sources are synced per live agent, under its own context.
- Turn tables, plan mode, reasoning effort, turn citations, budget signals,
  the request journal, sub-agent dedupe and the `run_workflow` guard live in
  the agent's context, so two agents can use the same thread or session id
  at the same time.

### Lifecycle

`RuntimeBuilder::max_agents` caps live agents (default
`DEFAULT_MAX_AGENTS`, 1024); `Runtime::agent` returns
`AgentError::AgentLimit` past it. `Runtime::remove_agent(id)` denies the
agent's parked approvals (resolution `agent_removed`), refuses new turns and
ends the ones in flight with `CoreError::AgentRemoved` (waiting up to ten
seconds for them to unwind), then drops its state slots and MCP host and
deregisters its context, which leaves its cron jobs dormant. The id is
reusable once it returns; `.purge()` also deletes the agent's home.
Dropping the last handle to an agent tears it down the same way with
resolution `agent_dropped`. Cancellation is cooperative: a tool already
executing, or a sub-agent the turn detached, may finish after removal.

### Still process-owned

- The event bus, keyring and credential store, and the API key (or
  session): one per runtime, shared by every agent.
- The approval gate engine and its store. Rows are labelled and decided per
  agent, but the store is one file per workspace.
- Sub-agent run-ledger rows. They are keyed by unique run ids; an owner
  column would need a schema change in the vendored `tinyagents-session`.
- The host-installed session store (`openhuman_rpc::session_store`) keeps
  its single-operator layout; the per-agent transcript layout applies to the
  core's file fallback and to embedded agents.
- Background-delivery busy flags and skill run cancellation, which are keyed
  by unique session and run ids.
- A per-turn `Turn::route` override reaches that turn only; detached
  sub-agents use the agent's own route.

### Out of scope

- A per-agent cost log. It is accounting rather than behaviour isolation,
  `Turn::meter` already reports per turn, and a per-agent budget is a
  separate request.
- Embedded agents delegating to one another. Peer delegation is a
  cross-agent trust decision that TinyHiveMind owns.
- An API to add a memory source to a running agent. `AgentSpec` memory
  sources are taken when the agent is created; nothing needs more yet.

## Authentication and the backend

Library mode has no user login. `RuntimeBuilder::api_key` stores a
TinyHumans API key in the runtime's credential store before the core boots.
Managed inference then sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, backend
REST calls send it as `x-api-key`, and the scheduler gate treats the runtime
as signed in. There is no `/auth/me` round trip and no session to expire. An
agent that names its own `Provider` never uses the key for inference.

The key covers the hosted features the core reaches: managed inference,
cloud embeddings, voice (STT and TTS), web search, media generation, the Jev
ranker, Composio and the other `/agent-integrations/*` tools, referral and
webhooks. Callers that can only send a bearer (the vendored STT and embedding
clients, the connector module's proxy route, the memory engine's sync) send
the key as `Authorization: Bearer`, which the backend accepts by its
`tiny_live_` / `tiny_test_` prefix. What a key may reach is decided by its
scopes on the backend (`inference`, `voice`, `search`, `media`, `storage`,
`account`, `connections`); a missing scope answers `403`, and a key minted
through the grant flow omits `connections` unless it was asked for. The
session-bound `/auth/*` flows (OAuth connect, channel link tokens, login
tokens), the realtime voice agent and the Socket.IO relay still need a
signed-in user. See
[`gitbooks/developing/tinyhumans-api-key.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/tinyhumans-api-key.md).

A host that drives backend features for a signed-in user passes a `Session`
to `RuntimeBuilder::session` (or `HarnessBuilder::session`, or later
`Auth::store`). The core stores it through `openhuman.auth_set_credential`
and never validates it. Obtaining and checking the JWT is the host's job,
which `openhuman_tinyhumans::session` does for the desktop app and TUI.
`Session::local` builds the offline `.local` token form, which authorizes
nothing at the backend.

The core reaches the hosted backend only through a `BackendTransport`
(re-exported here). This crate installs none. Without one, agents, memory,
skills, tools and RPC still work, and hosted surfaces (managed inference,
billing, integrations tools, cloud voice, channel relay) answer with a typed
`BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:` error. `openhuman_tinyhumans::RuntimeBuilder` installs
the SDK transport for you; `RuntimeBuilder::backend_transport` takes your own.

## Memory per tenant

Bind an agent with
`AgentSpec::memory(MemoryBinding::new(agent_id).root("team:acme"))` and its
turns run TinyMemory's lifecycle under `team:acme/agent:<agent_id>`.
`Runtime::memory("team:acme")` returns a `memory::Memory`, the operator's view
of that tenant: its agents, items, learnings and brain documents, with every
call confined to the root's subtree. `RuntimeBuilder::memory_engine` installs
a host-supplied engine in place of the configured one. See
[`docs/specs/memory-v2.md`](../../docs/specs/memory-v2.md).

## Conversations in a host store

By default an agent's transcripts, turn journal, run status, goals and todos
are files under the workspace. A host serving many users from one process
keeps them in its own database instead:

```rust,ignore
let runtime = Runtime::builder()
    .workspace(Workspace::stateless())          // nothing durable on disk
    .session_store(Arc::new(MyMongoStores::new(db)))
    .build()
    .await?;
```

The runtime asks the provider (`session_store::SessionStoreProvider`) for each
agent's stores by agent id, so a provider over a shared database scopes every
query by agent. A reopened agent resumes its thread from the store, in any
process. `InMemorySessionStores` keeps everything in memory, and the
conformance suites re-exported from `session_store` are what a host's
provider is held to. `Workspace::stateless()` refuses to build without a
store (`RuntimeError::NoSessionStore`); a private scratch directory, removed
with the runtime, still holds process-local caches. The desktop app, CLI and
TUI install `openhuman_rpc::session_store`, the classic on-disk layout behind
the same port.

### Scheduling

`Runtime::cron()` upserts named jobs (`JobSpec::agent` for a turn of a
runtime agent with its host tools, `JobSpec::system` for a handler registered
with `Runtime::on_system_job`), lists, removes, runs them now and reads their
history. A `ServiceSet` with `cron: true` starts the scheduler on `build()`
and stops it with the runtime; `start_services` / `stop_services` control it
explicitly. See [`gitbooks/developing/embedding.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/embedding.md#scheduling)
and `tests/cron_agents.rs`.

### Channels

`Runtime::channels().telegram(TelegramChannelSpec::new(token, agent_id))`
starts a Telegram listener whose every message is a turn of that runtime
agent: its prompt, its host tools and the chat's history. The agent must
exist first (`ChannelError::UnknownAgent` otherwise), and if it is dropped
later the bot answers that it is unavailable rather than falling back to the
orchestrator. Turns run as `ExternalChannel` and are capped at read-only:
tools that write or reach outside are withheld or refused at once. The
returned `ChannelListener` stops the bot when it is dropped. Behind the
`channels` feature (on by default). See the gitbook's "Channels" section and
`tests/channel_agents.rs`.

## Many users in one process: `ProfileRuntime`

`Runtime` serves one operator. A server that already authenticates its own
users and wants each of them isolated (their own workspace, credential,
threads, memory and policy) uses `ProfileRuntime` instead: the SaaS profile
host (`openhuman_core::profiles`) driven in-process, without the JSON-RPC
gateway.

```rust,no_run
# async fn demo() -> Result<(), openhuman_embed::ProfileError> {
use openhuman_embed::profiles::ProfileCredentialKind;
use openhuman_embed::{ProfileRuntime, RelayMessage, SaasConfig};

let profiles = ProfileRuntime::build(SaasConfig::new("/srv/openhuman")).await?;
let alice = profiles.provision("alice").await?;
profiles
    .set_credential(&alice.profile_id, ProfileCredentialKind::ApiKey, "th_...")
    .await?;

let handle = profiles.open("alice").await?;       // keeps alice open
let reply = handle.chat("t1", "hello").await?;    // web chat, final reply
let mut events = handle.events();                  // only alice's events
handle
    .relay_inbound(RelayMessage::new("telegram", "777", "555", "tg-1", "hi"))
    .await?;                                       // reply arrives as `channel_outbound`
# let _ = (reply, events.recv().await); Ok(()) }
```

- `ProfileRuntime::{build, builder}` boot `core::runtime::saas::build` with a
  `SaasConfig` (the operator's settings: root, slots, idle eviction, id mode,
  storage URL, node id, lease TTL). `ProfileRuntimeBuilder::session_store`
  installs a host session store first. When the configured service token file
  is missing, `build` writes a random owner-only one, since nothing serves a
  gateway here; the rest of the boot guard runs unchanged.
- `provision(user_id)`, `open(user_id)`, `list()`, `release(&ProfileId)`,
  `deprovision(&ProfileId)`, `set_credential(..)` and `shutdown()` map onto
  the `ProfileHost`. `open` answers `OpenError::HeldElsewhere(record)` for a
  profile another node holds the lease on.
- A `ProfileHandle` holds its profile **in use** while it (or a clone) lives:
  not evicted, and `release` refuses it. Every call runs under the profile's
  own `CoreContext`, through the same `USER_METHODS` surface as the gateway:
  `chat(thread, text)` (creates the thread, waits for `chat_done` /
  `chat_error`), `relay_inbound(RelayMessage)`, `events()`, `threads()`,
  `messages(thread)`, `call(method, params)` and `scope(fut)`.
- **It locks the process into SaaS mode** (`core/runtime/mode.rs`). It fails
  if any core already runs in the process, and once it is built
  `Runtime::builder()`, `Harness` and a second `ProfileRuntime` all refuse to
  boot. Use it in a process of its own.
- A profile's config is forced: it names no inference endpoint. Turns use
  managed inference through the installed backend transport
  (`openhuman_tinyhumans::install` in a real host) with each profile's own
  credential.

See [`examples/profiles.rs`](examples/profiles.rs), `tests/saas_profiles.rs`,
[`gitbooks/developing/saas-profiles.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/saas-profiles.md)
and [`profiles/README.md`](../openhuman-core/src/profiles/README.md).

## Tools on an agent

`AgentSpec::tools` gives an agent the host's own in-process tools, each with
its own schema on the wire. The factory runs once per session build, which
in practice is once per turn, and receives a `TurnContext` naming the agent
and the session. `Agent::attach_tools` adds a permanent named tool source to
an agent that already exists, which is how one library hands a configured
agent to another. See [`src/agent/README.md`](src/agent/README.md).

## Key types and entry points

- `Runtime` and `RuntimeBuilder` ([`src/runtime/`](src/runtime/)): build once per process,
  then call `Runtime::agent`. `Runtime::core()` gives non-turn access
  (config, auth) without exposing a way to start a turn.
- `AgentSpec` ([`src/agent/spec.rs`](src/agent/spec.rs)): the pure-data description of an agent.
  Ids must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`.
- `Agent` ([`src/agent/mod.rs`](src/agent/mod.rs)): a cheap clone handle. `run`, `turn`,
  `attach_tools`, and path accessors (`action_dir`, `home_dir`,
  `skills_dir`, `transcripts_dir`).
- `Turn` and `TurnOutcome` ([`src/turn.rs`](src/turn.rs)): configure, then `send`.
- `Access` ([`src/harness/access.rs`](src/harness/access.rs)): the autonomy tier and turn origin,
  always set together. Presets are `readonly`, `supervised` (the default)
  and `full`.
- `Provider` ([`src/harness/provider.rs`](src/harness/provider.rs)): `openai_compatible(base_url, key)`
  plus `model`, or `inherit()` for the machine's configured inference.
- `Workspace` ([`src/harness/workspace.rs`](src/harness/workspace.rs)): `Ephemeral` (default), `Dir`,
  `Stateless`, or `Inherit`.
- `Harness` ([`src/harness/mod.rs`](src/harness/mod.rs)): one runtime, one agent.
- `Core` ([`src/lib.rs`](src/lib.rs)): the typed facade over a caller-built runtime.
- `ProfileRuntime` and `ProfileHandle` ([`src/profiles.rs`](src/profiles.rs)): one SaaS profile per
  user, in-process. Exclusive with `Runtime` in a process.

## One model call, no runtime: `Completer`

A host that needs *a completion*, not an agent — a code reviewer asking for a
JSON verdict, a classifier, an extractor — uses `complete::Completer`. It needs
no `Runtime`, so none of the one-per-process and worker-stack constraints above
apply, and any number of calls can run concurrently.

```rust,no_run
# async fn demo() -> Result<(), openhuman_embed::CoreError> {
use openhuman_embed::complete::{ChatMessage, CompletionRequest, Completer, ResponseFormat};
use openhuman_embed::Route;

let completer = Completer::new(Route::openai_compatible("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1", "sk-…"))
    .header("X-Title", "my-app");
let response = completer
    .complete(
        CompletionRequest::new("openai/gpt-5-mini", vec![ChatMessage::user("Is 7 prime?")])
            .response_format(ResponseFormat::JsonObject)
            .max_tokens(64)
            .provider_options(serde_json::json!({"usage": {"include": true}})),
    )
    .await?;
println!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", response.structured, response.finish_reason, response.usage);
# Ok(())
# }
```

It differs from an agent turn on purpose: no prompt-injection guard (callers
pass untrusted text *as data*), no tools (a request declaring tools is
refused), no session or orchestrator prompt, and no model fallback — the
requested model is sent verbatim and `answered_model` reports what the
provider says actually ran. `finish_reason`, token usage (cached and reasoning
included) and the gateway-reported cost come back on the response; a
`CompletionObserver` sees every call, success or failure, for trace export.

`openhuman_embed::embeddings` re-exports the embedding models (OpenAI, Voyage,
Cohere, Ollama, mock) for hosts that keep their own vector index, with the
signature format unchanged so stored vectors stay in their partition.

## Locked-down agents: `HostOnly`

An agent that reads untrusted input (a PR diff) and must never act takes
`ToolScopeSpec::HostOnly`: the tools it can see and call are the ones the host
supplies (`AgentSpec::tools`, `Agent::attach_tools`) and nothing else.

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_embed::{AgentDefinitionSpec, AgentSpec, HostTurnTools, ToolScopeSpec};
# fn read_only_tools() -> Vec<Box<dyn openhuman_embed::Tool>> { Vec::new() }
let spec = AgentSpec::new("reviewer")
    .definition(
        AgentDefinitionSpec::new()
            .bare_prompt("You review pull requests.")
            .tools(ToolScopeSpec::HostOnly),
    )
    .tools(|_| HostTurnTools::advertised(read_only_tools()));
```

- No config-derived tool is built and no delegation tool is synthesised, so
  shell, file writes, network, memory, skills, MCP and sub-agents do not exist
  for the model. A deny-by-default gate refuses any other name it calls anyway.
- Access and sandbox are forced read-only, whatever `Access` was set (even
  after `AgentSpec::config`). Declaring MCP servers or skills is an error.
- The agent needs its own prompt. `bare_prompt(text)` makes `text` the whole
  system prompt: no identity, safety, tools, workspace or memory section.

Host tools should themselves be read-only: `HostOnly` bounds which tools
exist, not what they do.

Per turn, `Turn::response_format(ResponseFormat)` (the `complete` type) and
`Turn::max_tokens(n)` apply to every call of the tool loop on any runtime-owned
agent. `TurnOutcome` then carries `structured` (the reply parsed as JSON),
`finish_reason`, `answered_model`, and `usage.reasoning_tokens`.
`Turn::untrusted_input(true)` reads the message as data, so the prompt-injection
guard and screen are skipped. It is accepted only on a `HostOnly` agent; any
other agent refuses the turn (`untrusted_input_requires_host_only`).

## Feature flags

Every feature is a pass-through to the same-named feature on
`openhuman-core` (package `openhuman`): `default`, `http-server`, `inference`,
`documents`, `hosting`, `modules`, `voice`, `web3`, `runtime-node`, `media`,
`flows`, `skills`, `mcp`, `crash-reporting`, `channels`, `whatsapp-web`,
`file-logging` and `scheduler-gate`. A gate added to the core has to be
forwarded here (and then by `openhuman-tinyhumans` and `openhuman-cli`);
[`scripts/ci/check-feature-forwarding.mjs`](../../scripts/ci/check-feature-forwarding.mjs) checks the chain.

Three features also gate this crate's own surface. `channels` adds `Runtime::channels`, `Channels`, `TelegramChannelSpec`, `ChannelListener`, `ChannelError` and `StreamMode`. `mcp` adds `HttpHeader`,
`McpAuthConfig`, `McpServer`, `AgentSpec::mcp` and `HarnessBuilder::mcp`.
`skills` adds `AgentSpec::skills_dir` and `HarnessBuilder::skills_dir`.

[`docs/library-minimal-recipe.md`](../../docs/library-minimal-recipe.md) has a
measured minimal feature set, and
[`gitbooks/developing/performance.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/performance.md)
has the resulting binary sizes and per-agent memory.

## Boundaries

- The only in-repo dependency is `openhuman-core` with
  `default-features = false`. Every capability comes from a forwarded
  feature.
- No JSON-RPC here. This crate does not depend on `openhuman-rpc`; `Outcome`
  and `StructuredRpcError` are core types. `openhuman-app` and
  `openhuman-tui` use `openhuman-rpc` and the core directly and do not use
  this crate.
- No backend client. The hosted transport, product identity, login-token
  exchange and `/auth/me` live in `openhuman-tinyhumans`.
- The agent loop, transcripts, session identity and tool-call parsing belong
  to [`vendor/tinyagents`](../../vendor/tinyagents/) (repo `tinyhumansai/tinyagents`); the `Tool` trait
  belongs to its nested `tinytools`. Use the `Tool` re-exported here: a
  separately added `tinytools` builds an incompatible type.
- Memory contracts come from [`vendor/tinymemory`](../../vendor/tinymemory/) (`tinymemory-api`).

## Gotchas

- A `ProfileRuntime` locks the process to SaaS mode for good: build it in a
  process that runs no `Runtime`, `Harness` or caller-built core, before and
  after.
- One runtime per process. The keyring master key, the RPC bearer, the
  event bus and the `Once`-guarded domain subscribers are process-scoped
  (`CoreContext::init`). A second `RuntimeBuilder::build` returns
  `RuntimeError::AlreadyRunning`; a second harness returns
  `HarnessError::AlreadyRunning`. `Core::from_runtime` is not guarded, but
  the same rule applies to the `CoreRuntime` beneath it. The slot is
  released only when the `Runtime` and every `Agent` built on it are
  dropped.
- Build the tokio runtime yourself. A turn is a deep async state machine,
  and a nested sub-agent overflows tokio's default 2 MiB worker stack, so
  `#[tokio::main]` is not enough. `embed::process` builds one sized for
  turns (`AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES`, `MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS`, both re-exported
  there), so the host needs no core dependency to name them:

  ```rust,no_run
  let runtime = openhuman_embed::process::tokio_runtime().expect("tokio runtime");
  ```

- Access has two halves. The autonomy tier drives `SecurityPolicy`, and the
  turn origin (a task-local) drives the approval gate. `Access::full()` sets
  both; setting only the tier through `config` gives an agent whose acting
  tools refuse while the transcript looks plausible. `readonly()` and
  `supervised()` set no origin and leave the approval gate on, so an
  unattended supervised agent stalls on approvals until they expire.
- When building a `CoreRuntime` yourself, set `config_path` together with
  `workspace_dir` (`CoreBuilder::workspace(dir)` does both). Credentials,
  auth profiles and the keyring file resolve beside `config_path`, so a
  workspace-only override reads the operator's real credentials. `Runtime`
  and `Harness` handle this for `Ephemeral`, `Stateless` and `Dir`, and the
  `AgentSpec::config` escape hatch cannot move it.
- Supply skills through `skills_dir`, which copies bundles. Skill discovery
  rejects symlinked bundles, so linking them in silently does nothing.
- `Provider::model` is advisory. A model no provider serves falls back to
  the default rather than failing, and a route with no model resolved is
  ignored.
- A `Route` (or `Provider::openai_compatible`) that pairs a key with a plain
  `http://` endpoint is refused before dispatch with
  `CoreError::InsecureRoute`. A route without a key is allowed.
- A resumed session keeps its first system prompt and tool list. Prompt
  changes and a tool factory that returns a different belt only reach new
  sessions.

## Tests

The integration suites under [`tests/`](tests/README.md) each build one
runtime per process against `wiremock` providers; unit tests sit beside
their modules as `*_tests.rs`.

```bash
cargo test -p openhuman-embed --features inference,mcp,skills
cargo test -p openhuman-embed --features inference,mcp,skills --test runtime_agents
cargo test -p openhuman-embed --features inference,mcp,skills --test cron_agents
cargo test -p openhuman-embed --features inference,mcp,skills --test channel_agents
cargo test -p openhuman-embed --test saas_profiles
```

`tests/channel_agents.rs` drives a runtime agent from a mocked Telegram Bot API: the bound agent answers with its prompt and read-only host tool under the `ExternalChannel` origin, its write tool is withheld and refused, and the reply is posted back to the chat.
`tests/saas_profiles.rs` boots a `ProfileRuntime` on a temp root against a mocked inference endpoint: two users on thread `t1` see only their own messages and ride their own credential, a held handle keeps its profile from being released, a relayed Telegram message lands on the user's `channel:` thread with its reply on that user's events only, and the process refuses any other core afterwards.
`tests/cron_agents.rs` runs a cron job as a runtime agent with its host tool under the
`TrustedAutomation { Cron }` origin, records a system job handler's error, and starts and
stops the scheduler with the runtime.

The repository-root [`examples/embed_headless.rs`](../../examples/embed_headless.rs) and [`examples/embed_kernel.rs`](../../examples/embed_kernel.rs)
use this crate's `Runtime` (`Runtime::builder()`, then `core_runtime().invoke`
for raw RPC methods). They are `[[example]]` targets of `openhuman-cli`:
`cargo run -p openhuman-cli --example embed_headless`.

## Relationship to other crates

Its only in-repo dependency is `openhuman-core` (package `openhuman`) with
`default-features = false`: every capability comes from a feature forwarded
above. It does not depend on `openhuman-rpc`; `Outcome` and `StructuredRpcError`
are core types (`openhuman_core::core`). `openhuman-app` and `openhuman-tui`
depend on `openhuman-rpc` for its client (and the app on its server) and on
`openhuman-core`; neither uses `openhuman-embed`.

## Permanent tools on supplied agents

Hosts can pass an existing configured `Agent` to another library, which adds
its tools through `Agent::attach_tools` without constructing a replacement.
Attachments are shared by clones, always directly advertised, and update only
their managed system catalogue when a continuing conversation gains tools.
See [agent attachment semantics and example](src/agent/README.md#attach-tools-to-an-existing-agent)
for source identity, collision errors, policy composition, and runtime identity.
