//! Standalone server entry points, and the build-and-serve step the shared
//! host boot ([`crate::host`]) runs.
//!
//! `run_server` and `run_server_headless` are thin shims over the
//! [`RuntimeBuilder::cli`] preset: each applies the caller's services and
//! listener, then builds the runtime and [`serve`](super::serve::serve)s it.
//! `run_server_saas` is separate: it loads a `SaasConfig` and boots through
//! `core::runtime::saas::build` (a SaaS `CoreBuilder`, not the preset). The
//! preset carries every
//! domain family, the standalone `HostKind` (CLI or Docker, via
//! `HostKind::detect_standalone`), the `OPENHUMAN_E2E` tool-group switch, and
//! no supplied config (the core discovers the operator's install).
//!
//! None of these connect the TinyHumans backend: [`crate::host`] is the entry
//! that does (`desktop_builder` / `serve_desktop` for the embedded desktop
//! core, `cli` for `openhuman-core`). A caller of a bare `run_server*` installs
//! the transport itself (`openhuman_tinyhumans::install`).
