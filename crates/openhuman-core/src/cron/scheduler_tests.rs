// ── A6: the retry loop must honour its own permanent-failure classifiers ─────
//
// Matrix 9.3.3 "Retry Handling" was 🟡 with the note "Backoff branches partial".
// What existed were classifier tests — `agent_error_to_user_message_classifies_
// provider_retryable` / `_non_retryable`, `is_local_provider_unreachable_failure_
// keeps_short_loopback_send_error_retryable` — which assert the *predicate* in
// isolation. None of them asserts that `execute_job_with_retry` ACTS on the
// predicate.
//
// That gap is the dangerous half. If a permanent classifier stops being
// consulted, every predicate test stays green while an insufficient-credits job
// retries its whole budget against a wallet that cannot pay, and a
// security-policy block is re-attempted instead of halting. The loop's own
// comments state the intent ("permanent across the backoff loop") and nothing
// enforced it.
//
// These two tests observe the loop from outside, with no mocking: a shell job
// whose command appends one line per execution turns "how many attempts did the
// loop make" into a number on disk.

/// Shell command that records one line per execution and then fails.
///
/// `sh -c` so the append and the exit status are one command string, which is
/// what `CronJob::command` carries.
