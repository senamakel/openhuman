# orchestration

`agent::orchestration` is the control plane for coordinating multiple agent
workers from one parent session: agent teams, background command-center views,
declarative multi-phase workflows, git-worktree isolation for parallel coding
workers, and the tool surface LLMs call to spawn/steer/wait-on sub-agents. The
lower-level `agent::harness` remains the execution engine: prompt
construction, policy-filtered tools, model selection, and the sub-agent run
loop itself.

The generic durable coordination model lives in
`tinyagents-orchestration`: team/workflow types, validation, run-ledger
services, graph composition, member prompt construction, message watermark
delivery, and diagnostic workflow topology. OpenHuman imports those APIs
directly. This module retains the product adapters: Config and root-parent
construction, model/tool selection, `run_subagent`, progress and BUS events,
RPC/tool formatting, and OpenHuman's worktree policy.

## Responsibilities

- Register, wait on, and cancel child agent runs ([`ops.rs`](./ops.rs),
  `AgentOrchestrationSession`) as thin wrappers over TinyAgents'
  `DetachedTaskRegistry`.
- Host adapters for durable teams and workflows: RPC schemas, root-parent
  worker execution, model selection, cancellation policy, and BUS/progress
  integration. Their host-neutral types, storage services, scheduling graphs,
  prompt composition, and delivery bookkeeping are in
  `tinyagents-orchestration`.
- A read-only command-center view over background agent runs plus stop/retry/
  continue/follow-up control verbs (`command_center/`).
- OpenHuman's `OpenHumanWorktreeIsolation` adapter and RPC surface; generic
  worktree operations are used directly from `tinyagents_harness::workspace`.
- User-driven cancel/steer of detached (`spawn_async_subagent`) background
  sub-agents from the frontend background-tasks drawer ([`subagent_control.rs`](./subagent_control.rs)).
- Mirroring detached sub-agent lifecycle into a TinyAgents task store, batching
  finished background results back into chat, and settling run-ledger rows
  from the global bus regardless of the parent turn's lifecycle
  (`running_subagents*.rs`, [`background_completions.rs`](./background_completions.rs),
  [`completion_notice.rs`](./completion_notice.rs),
  [`background_delivery.rs`](./background_delivery.rs), [`run_ledger_finalize.rs`](./run_ledger_finalize.rs)). The delivery turn runs
  on the originating thread's cached chat session via
  `web_chat::run_system_turn_on_thread`, never on a throwaway host.
- A shared root `ParentExecutionContext` builder for surfaces that spawn real
  sub-agents from a background task with no enclosing agent turn on the stack
  ([`parent_context/builder.rs`](./parent_context/builder.rs)).

## Key files

- [`mod.rs`](./mod.rs): module wiring and re-exports.
- `ops.rs` / [`types.rs`](./types.rs): `AgentOrchestrationSession`, `OrchestrationError`,
  `AgentSnapshot`, `OrchestrationTaskStatus`, `SpawnAgentRequest`/`Response`,
  `WaitAgentOptions`/`Response`.
- `agent_teams/`: OpenHuman's live member-worker adapter for the generic
  `tinyagents_orchestration::teams` service: it supplies Config, the root
  parent context, model/tool execution, progress tracing, and BUS-facing
  lifecycle behavior.
- `command_center/`: read-only grouped view of background agent runs
  (`ops.rs`) plus stop/retry/continue/follow-up transitions (`control.rs`).
- `workflow_runs/`: OpenHuman's live workflow execution and RPC adapters;
  workflow definitions, durable state, validation, graphs, and neutral engine
  mechanics are imported directly from `tinyagents_orchestration::workflow`.
- [`delegation.rs`](./delegation.rs): production worker for TinyAgents' durable
  plan→execute⇄review→finalize graph; every stage runs through `run_subagent`.
- `spawn_parallel_agents` uses `tinyagents_graph::parallel::map_reduce` with
  OpenHuman-owned request validation, worktree policy, dispatch, workers, and
  result formatting. The former parallel coordinator/request graph modules
  were removed; there is no OpenHuman forwarding layer around the graph API.
- [`subagent_events.rs`](./subagent_events.rs): the single owner that constructs and publishes
  `DomainEvent::Subagent{Spawned,Completed,Failed,AwaitingUser}`.
- `subagent_control.rs`: manual cancel/steer of detached background
  sub-agents; the manual counterpart to the automatic thread-close
  cancellation in `crate::threads`.
- [`worktree.rs`](./worktree.rs) / [`worktree_schemas.rs`](./worktree_schemas.rs): `OpenHumanWorktreeIsolation` and the
  list/status/diff/remove RPC surface. They call
  `tinyagents_harness::workspace` directly rather than maintaining aliases.
- `subagent_sessions/`: durable subagent session records
  (`DurableSubagentSessionSummary`, `SubagentSessionStore`) used for
  reuse/dedup decisions across turns.
- `parent_context/builder.rs`: `build_root_parent` / `with_root_parent`, the
  single blessed entry point for constructing a root `ParentExecutionContext`
  outside an agent turn.
- [`running_subagents.rs`](./running_subagents.rs) + `running_subagents/` (`registry.rs`, `roster.rs`,
  `resolve.rs`, `cancel.rs`, `steering.rs`, `wait.rs`, `task_ledger.rs`): the
  detached sub-agent host glue (registry instance and metadata, store path,
  steering, boot reconcile). The status type, wait, ledger helpers, roster and
  session resolution live in `tinyagents_orchestration::subagent`
  (`DetachedSubagentStatus`, `wait_detached`, `SubagentIdentity`, ...).
  `background_completions.rs` is the host adapter over the harness
  `tinyagents_tasks::CompletionRouter` (one durable `JsonlCompletionStore` per
  workspace at `.openhuman/background_completions.jsonl`, parent key = chat
  thread id): the router owns the queue, dedupe, tombstones (collected inline,
  stopped, cancelled thread), attempt counting and give-up, so a completion that
  was never delivered is redelivered after a restart
  (`background_delivery::recover_on_boot`, wired next to the orphaned-task
  reconcile in `core/runtime/bootstrap.rs`). `completion_notice.rs` is the
  `<background_agent_*>` wording (a `CompletionFormatter`) and the
  `[BACKGROUND_DELIVERY_FAILED]` give-up notice. `background_delivery.rs` keeps
  the host policy: idle-gated, debounced (3s), batched delivery of finished
  background runs back into chat, the system turn, and the give-up writer fed by
  `mark_failed`. `run_ledger_finalize.rs` is the
  global-bus subscriber that settles ledger rows for runs that outlive their
  spawning turn.
- [`fleet_tools.rs`](./fleet_tools.rs): decides which fleet-control tools (`wait_subagent`,
  `steer_subagent`, `wait_loop`, `close_subagent`) a given parent agent's
  definition actually exposes, so the delegation prompts and the
  `[active_subagents]` roster text never name a tool the model cannot call
  (#5701).
- [`tools.rs`](./tools.rs): declares the LLM-callable tool files under `tools/` (see
  [Agent tools](#agent-tools)).

## Public surface

- `AgentOrchestrationSession`, `OrchestrationError`: `ops.rs`.
- `AgentSnapshot`, `OrchestrationTaskStatus`, `SpawnAgentRequest`/`Response`,
  `WaitAgentOptions`/`Response`: `types.rs`.
- `OpenHumanWorktreeIsolation`: `worktree.rs`; direct TinyAgents worktree
  types are `GitWorktreeBaseRef`, `GitWorktreeError`, and
  `GitWorktreeStatus` from `tinyagents_harness::workspace`.
- Controller schema/registration pairs re-exported from `mod.rs`:
  `all_agent_team_*`, `all_command_center_*`, `all_workflow_run_*`,
  `all_worktree_*`, `all_subagent_control_*`.

## RPC

Five controller pairs are registered in `crate::core::all`:

| Namespace | Source | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_team` | `agent_teams::{all_agent_team_controller_schemas, all_agent_team_registered_controllers}` | `create`, `list`, `get`, `assign_task`, `claim_task`, `message_member`, `list_messages`, `complete_task`, `shutdown_member`, `close`, `start_member` |
| `agent_work` | `command_center::{all_command_center_controller_schemas, all_command_center_registered_controllers}` | `list`, `control` |
| `workflow_run` | `workflow_runs::{all_workflow_run_controller_schemas, all_workflow_run_registered_controllers}` | `list_definitions`, `list`, `get`, `start`, `stop`, `resume` |
| `worktree` | `worktree_schemas::{all_controller_schemas, all_registered_controllers}` | `list`, `status`, `diff`, `remove` |
| `subagent` | `subagent_control::{all_controller_schemas, all_registered_controllers}` | `cancel`, `steer` |

## Agent tools

`tools.rs` declares the `tools/` directory files (via `#[path]`) and
re-exports them through `crate::tools` ([`tools/mod.rs`](../../tools/mod.rs):
`pub use crate::agent::orchestration::tools::*`). LLM-callable tools, by wire
name:

- Spawn: `spawn_subagent`, `spawn_async_subagent`, `spawn_parallel_agents`,
  `spawn_worker_thread`.
- Control: `steer_subagent`, `continue_subagent`, `close_subagent`,
  `wait_subagent`, `wait`, `wait_loop`, `list_subagents`.
- Delegation: `DelegateGraphTool` (`delegate_graph.rs`),
  `ArchetypeDelegationTool` (name set per instance, e.g. `research`),
  and `CollapsedDelegationTool` (`delegate_to`).
  There is no integrations delegate: connected Composio actions are
  `Deferred` tools on the orchestrator's own belt, found through
  `tool_search` and called directly ([`tools/orchestrator_tools.rs`](../../tools/orchestrator_tools.rs)).

`dispatch.rs` (the shared spawn path every tool above
calls), `awaiting_user.rs` (the awaiting-user envelope), and
`worker_thread.rs` (worker thread creation) are `pub(crate)` helpers, not
tools. Live harness registrations use typed `ToolDispatch<(),
OpenHumanRunContext>` wrappers and fork the parent carrier for every child,
so cancellation, origin, progress, dispatch state, thread, and workspace stay
attached. `delegate_to` retains its concrete enum-to-agent routing table in
its schema metadata at registration; it never broadens a call by rebuilding
targets from the global agent registry. `delegate_graph` has a dedicated typed
registration for its durable plan→execute→review loop, while the optional
config-driven `delegate` registration preserves the configured executor and
races it against the inherited cancellation token. Execution itself routes through
`agent::subagent_host::run_subagent`.

## Persistence

- `tinyagents_session::run_ledger`: the `agent_runs`,
  `agent_teams`/`agent_team_members`/`agent_team_tasks`, and `workflow_runs`
  tables plus the shared `run_events` log, backed by
  `{workspace}/session_db/sessions.db` (see [`agent/session_db/mod.rs`](../session_db/mod.rs)). Every
  spawn path (`spawn_subagent`, `spawn_async_subagent`,
  `spawn_parallel_agents`, `continue_subagent`, `dispatch`) writes a `running`
  `agent_runs` row; `run_ledger_finalize.rs` settles it from the global event
  bus so detached runs that outlive their spawning turn are not left `running`
  forever.
- `subagent_sessions/`: `SubagentSessionStore` writes
  `{workspace}/.openhuman/subagent_sessions.json` (atomic tmp-file rename), or
  one `subagent_sessions` document per session under the acting agent's scope
  when a storage backend is configured (`store_documents.rs`).
- `running_subagents/task_ledger.rs`: the detached-task ledger is
  `{workspace}/.openhuman/orchestration_tasks.jsonl`, or `orchestration_tasks`
  documents per storage scope when a backend is configured
  (`task_ledger_documents.rs`); the boot orphan sweep is skipped on a shared
  backend.
- `delegation.rs`: checkpoints `DelegationState` through
  `tinyagents_graph::SqliteCheckpointer` in `graph_checkpoints.db` under the
  workspace.

## Policy inheritance

Policy inheritance is delegated to `agent::subagent_host::run_subagent`, which
derives child tools, model routing, sandbox context, spawn depth, and
progress from the parent `ParentExecutionContext`. This module only adds
lineage and lifecycle semantics; it must not widen tool visibility beyond
what the harness exposes to the child.

## Dependencies

- `agent::harness`: `run_subagent`, `fork_context::ParentExecutionContext`,
  `definition::{AgentDefinition, AgentDefinitionRegistry}`.
- `tinyagents_graph::orchestration`: `DetachedTaskRegistry`,
  `OrchestrationTaskStatus`, `TaskId`.
- `tinyagents_session::run_ledger`: durable storage for teams, workflow runs,
  and agent run rows.
- `tinyagents_graph`: the graph engine used for workflow phase scheduling,
  agent-team routing, and parallel map/reduce fanout.
- `core::bus::BUS`: `DomainEvent::AgentOrchestration*` /
  `Subagent*` publication and subscription.
- `web_chat::progress_bridge`: the per-turn progress-channel counterpart to
  `run_ledger_finalize.rs`'s global-bus settlement.

## Used by

- `crate::tools` (`tools/mod.rs`) re-exports every tool in `tools/` for the
  LLM tool-calling loop.
- `threads`: the automatic thread-close cancellation counterpart to
  `subagent_control.rs`'s manual cancel.
- `crate::core::all`: registers the five controller pairs above.

## Notes

- Namespace `agent_team` is distinct from the existing `team` domain (backend
  org/team membership); `workflow_run` is distinct from the `workflows`
  domain (SKILL.md/WORKFLOW.md bundle discovery).
- `wait_agents` prunes an entry once it observes a terminal status. Every
  in-tree caller spawns and waits exactly once.
- `worktree.rs` only ever operates on the user's project repo rooted at the
  agent's `action_dir`, never on OpenHuman's own source tree; `remove`
  refuses a dirty worktree unless `force = true`.
