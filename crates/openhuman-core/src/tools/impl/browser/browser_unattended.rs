//! Opt-in pass for allow-listed browser actions in trusted unattended turns.
//!
//! Every consequential browser action asks the forced host approval gate,
//! which parks only for a routable WebChat turn and denies everything else.
//! A cron job, background job or approval-free workflow has nobody to answer,
//! so it could not even follow a "next page" link. `[browser]
//! unattended_actions` names the gated kinds such a turn may take without
//! asking; every other origin keeps the forced gate exactly as it was.
