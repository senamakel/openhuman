/// runs once, at creation. Without an equivalent here, a flow created
/// `enabled: true` with a manual/no-op trigger could later have an
/// automatic-trigger graph saved onto it — via the `save_workflow` agent
/// tool, the canvas Save button, a proposal apply, or any other
/// `flows_update` caller — and go LIVE immediately with no user review
/// (confirmed live: a flow started firing on an unreviewed 8am schedule).
/// So: when the *new* graph's trigger is automatic and the *previous*
/// graph's trigger was NOT automatic (a manual/none → automatic
/// transition), this forces the persisted `enabled` back to `false` in the
/// same store write — the user must explicitly re-arm via
/// `flows_set_enabled` after reviewing the new trigger. An automatic →
/// automatic re-edit (e.g. tweaking a cron expression) is left alone — the
/// user already opted in once, and re-disarming on every edit would just be
/// friction.
///
/// The override is applied **unconditionally** on a manual/none → automatic
/// transition — it does *not* gate on whether the flow *looked* enabled in
/// the `existing` read above. That read is a snapshot taken before
/// `store::update_flow_graph`'s own guarded UPDATE re-reads the row; a
/// concurrent `flows_set_enabled(id, true)` landing in the gap would leave
/// this snapshot stale while the row is actually enabled by the time the
/// guarded UPDATE runs — and since `set_enabled` bumps `updated_at` too,
/// such a race wouldn't even trip the optimistic-concurrency conflict, it
/// would just silently persist the automatic graph as enabled (the exact
/// bug this rule exists to close). Gating on the stale `existing.enabled`
/// re-opens that race; forcing the override on every transition, enabled-or-
/// not, is exactly as safe as Rule 1's at-create version — a transition on
/// an already-disabled flow is just a no-op write of `enabled=false` over
