//! The agents that keep records in their own storage scope, and a way for
//! background work to visit each of them.
//!
//! Work done inside an agent's turn runs under that agent's `CoreContext`
//! (`session_agent`), so with a storage backend installed its cron jobs,
//! flows, approvals and the rest land in that agent's scope. Background work
//! — the cron scheduler, pollers, boot sweeps — runs under the process
//! default context, which names no agent, and on its own would only ever see
//! the `local` scope. [`for_each_scope`] closes that gap: it runs a step once
//! for `local` and once under each known agent's context.
//!
//! An agent is known when it is live in this process
//! (`core::runtime::AgentContextRegistry`, which embed agents register on
//! build) — its own context is used, with its configuration, policy and
//! tools — or when an earlier process recorded its id in the backend's
//! `local` scope (`storage_agents`, written by [`record`] when the agent
//! registers), so a restart still visits agents the host has not re-created
//! yet; those are visited under the default context acting for them
//! (`CoreContext::for_agent`).
//!
//! Without a backend [`for_each_agent`] visits nothing: the SQLite stores
//! these loops read do not split by agent. In SaaS mode the process has no
//! `local` scope and per-user background work is driven by
//! `profiles::background`, so agent ids are not recorded and
//! [`for_each_scope`] skips `local`.
