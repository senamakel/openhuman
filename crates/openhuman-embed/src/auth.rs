//! Auth sub-facade — the session a turn runs under.
//!
//! # When an embedder needs this
//!
//! [`HostKind::Library`](openhuman_core::core::types::HostKind::Library) accepts a
//! caller-supplied provider without an OpenHuman app login. An embedder needs a
//! real session only when it also calls authenticated TinyHumans backend
//! services, or when it deliberately selects a desktop/standalone host mode
//! whose custom-provider policy still requires an active session.
//!
//! Before this existed, every embedder reached for `Core::raw()` and hand-wrote
//! `openhuman.auth_store_session` — which is how an unrelated host ends up
//! owning a copy of the `{result, logs}` envelope heuristic and a private
//! version of the auth state struct.
//!
//! # Two kinds of session
//!
//! [`Session::backend`] is a real JWT. **The core does not validate it**: the
//! embedder is responsible for having obtained it from the TinyHumans backend
//! (a login-token exchange, `/auth/me`) and hands it over together with the
//! user id it belongs to — through [`Session::user`], or implicitly through
//! the JWT's subject claim. [`Session::local`] is the compatibility/offline
//! form — a token ending in `.local`, carrying its own user payload, which the
//! core recognizes and never sends anywhere. It authorizes nothing at the
//! backend and is not needed by the default library harness.
