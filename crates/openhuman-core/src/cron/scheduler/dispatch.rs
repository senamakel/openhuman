//! Dispatching due jobs without holding the poll loop.
//!
//! The poll loop used to await its whole batch (`buffer_unordered`), so one
//! long agent turn kept every other job — including ones that came due during
//! it — waiting for the next poll that could only happen once it finished.
//! Now each due job is spawned onto the [`JobDispatcher`]'s task set and the
//! poll returns at once; a semaphore keeps at most `scheduler.max_concurrent`
//! jobs executing. Dropping the dispatcher (the loop's task is aborted on
//! shutdown) aborts the jobs it still owns.
//!
//! Because the loop no longer waits, two guards replace the old implicit one:
//!
//! - **Run claim**: a job is claimed (`cron::ops::try_acquire_run`, the same
//!   claim Run Now and the run tool take) from dispatch until its run is
//!   persisted, and a claimed job is never dispatched again.
//! - **Claimed slot**: a recurring job's `next_run` is advanced to its next
//!   occurrence at dispatch, so a running job is not "due" on every poll. When
//!   it finishes, the usual reschedule recomputes `next_run` from that moment,
//!   exactly as before. A job that comes due again while still running has
//!   genuinely missed a slot: a default job skips it silently (the historical
//!   behaviour, when such slots were swallowed by the blocked loop); a
//!   single-flight job ([`crate::cron::policy::JobPolicy::single_flight`])
//!   records it as a `skipped` run.
