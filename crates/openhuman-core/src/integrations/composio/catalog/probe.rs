// [`compute_composio_array_path`] above is entirely schema-derived — it has
// nothing to walk when Composio (or the backend-proxied listing path, see
// [`crate::integrations::composio::ComposioToolFunction::output_parameters`]'s
// doc) simply never publishes `output_parameters` for an action. Verified
// live: EVERY GitHub action's `get_tool_contract` (including the curated
// `GITHUB_LIST_REPOSITORY_ISSUES`) comes back `output_fields: [],
// output_schema: null, primary_array_path: null` — there is no schema at all
// to fix a walker bug in. The one remaining source of ground truth is the
// real response itself, so [`probe_tool_output_sample`] makes ONE bounded,
// READ-only, REAL Composio call and derives the same shape of hint
// (`primary_array_path`/`output_fields`) from the ACTUAL value instead.
//
// This is the exact bug observed live on flow "funny reminders v2": with no
// schema to consult, the builder guessed `split_out.path = "json.data"` (the
// whole envelope payload — one item, the `{issues:[...]}` container) instead
// of the real `"json.data.issues"`, and the downstream condition/agent saw
// the wrong shape and produced zero reminders.

/// Top-level [`crate::integrations::composio::ComposioExecuteResponse`] fields
/// that are never part of the tool's own payload — skipped at the ROOT by
/// [`compute_primary_array_path_from_value`]'s scan so an envelope field
/// never masquerades as (or shadows) the real array. None of these are ever
/// arrays in practice, but the skip is explicit so a future envelope field
/// can't silently win a shallowest-wins tie against a real nested array.
/// `pub(crate)` because the workflow adapter seam passes this into the
/// vendor-neutral walker in [`crate::json_schema`]. That walker
/// deliberately takes the skip-list as a parameter rather than knowing any
/// provider's envelope shape, so this constant is the piece of Composio
