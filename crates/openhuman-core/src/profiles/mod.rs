//! Profiles: in SaaS mode, each user is served as one profile.
//!
//! A profile is the tenant: one user's config, credential, workspace and
//! sandbox, laid out like the desktop's user directory
//! (`<root>/users/<profile-id>/`, the shared
//! [`ProfileLayout`](crate::config::schema::ProfileLayout)). The gateway
//! authenticates users; this domain turns a gateway user id into the
//! profile that serves that user ([`ProfileId`], per
//! [`ProfileIdMode`]), lays out its private state ([`layout`]), forces the
//! config it runs with ([`layout::profile_config`]), and keeps the open
//! profiles of the process ([`ProfileHost`]). The operator plane provisions
//! and inspects them through the `profiles.*` controllers ([`schemas`]).
//!
//! The isolation boundary is the profile's own [`CoreContext`]: its config,
//! workspace, `profile` (the tenant key) and `session_agent` (both set to the
//! profile id). Work for one user runs under that context, which is what the
//! config loader, the session store and the per-thread caches key on.
//!
//! One process hosts a profile at a time: opening one takes its lease
//! ([`lease`]), and the provisioned set lives in the [`registry`] — the
//! shared storage backend when one is configured, else `profile.toml` files.
//!
//! [`CoreContext`]: crate::core::runtime::CoreContext
