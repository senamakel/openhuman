//! Which agent a paired device belongs to.
//!
//! A device paired from inside an agent's context is stored in that agent's
//! storage scope (`crate::storage`), and the RPCs it sends through the tunnel
//! must run as that agent — not as the process default, which would read and
//! write somebody else's records. The tunnel subscriber runs outside any
//! agent, so it asks here, per frame:
//!
//! 1. the pending pairing session, which recorded the agent that started it;
//! 2. the owners this process has already resolved;
//! 3. otherwise each storage scope, for a device paired by an earlier process
//!    (`crate::storage::agents::for_each_scope`).
//!
//! `None` means the `local` scope (a single-user host, or no backend).
