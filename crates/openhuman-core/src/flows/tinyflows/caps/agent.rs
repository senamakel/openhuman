/// [`AgentRunner`] backing an `agent` node's `agent_ref`. It runs the selected
/// agent kind by one of two paths, chosen by [`route_for_agent_ref`]:
///
/// 1. **Full harness turn** (the common case, Phase A). When `agent_ref` names a
///    harness [`AgentDefinition`](crate::agent::harness::definition::AgentDefinition),
///    the node builds a real session agent
///    ([`OpenHumanSessionHost::from_config_for_agent`](crate::agent::OpenHumanSessionHost::from_config_for_agent)
///    + `set_agent_definition_name`) and drives one full turn via
///
///    [`OpenHumanSessionHost::run_single`](crate::agent::OpenHumanSessionHost::run_single) — the
///    complete tool loop. The definition's `ToolScope` / `sandbox_mode` /
///    `max_iterations` govern the turn, so an agent node gains its curated
///    toolset with no graph change. This is the same harness pattern
///    `flows_build` / `flows_discover` / cron use, so "every node
///    is a tinyagents graph" still holds: `run_single` itself routes through the
///    default agent graph, i.e. a nested tinyagents graph (the agent turn) inside
///    the flow's tinyagents graph.
/// 2. **Persona-shaping completion fallback** (no regression for custom agents).
///    When `agent_ref` only resolves to a custom
///    [`AgentRegistryEntry`](crate::agent::registry::AgentRegistryEntry)
///    (no harness definition), the node keeps the original single-completion
///    behavior: the entry's `system_prompt` / `model` are shaped on top of the
///    node request and run through [`OpenHumanLlm::complete`].
///
/// **Security.** No new origin is scoped here: the engine future already runs
/// under the flow's `Workflow` origin (`turn_origin`), so the user's autonomy
/// tier + approval gate apply to the inner turn automatically, and the agent
/// definition's `ToolScope`/sandbox is the inner gate. `agent_ref` is resolved
/// from trusted node config (never model output), so a prompt-injected
/// completion cannot pick an arbitrary agent kind.
///
/// **Per-item cost.** In per-item execution mode the engine calls
/// [`run_agent`](AgentRunner::run_agent) once per input item, so a full harness
/// turn (with memory injection) fans out one `Agent` per item. Since the engine
/// gained bounded per-item concurrency those calls also arrive *simultaneously*,
/// so the host-side guard this doc used to defer is now
/// [`HARNESS_AGENT_SLOTS`] — see it for why the engine's own `concurrency`
/// bound is not enough. Memory injection per node turn is accepted for this
/// first cut (skip-memory is a follow-up).
///
/// **Concurrency safety.** `run_agent` is re-entrant by construction: it builds
/// a fresh [`Agent`](crate::agent::OpenHumanSessionHost) per call and stamps any
/// model override onto a *cloned* `Config`, so concurrent calls never mutate
/// shared state. The origin escalation and approval-run context are task-locals
/// propagated by the engine's `buffer_unordered` (which polls every item on the
/// caller's task), so HITL gating still applies to every fanned-out turn.
