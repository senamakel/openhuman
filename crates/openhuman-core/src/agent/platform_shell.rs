//! Cross-platform shell selection for spawning agent shell commands.
//!
//! Consolidates the "which shell binary do we spawn?" decision so
//! [`NativeRuntime::build_shell_command`](super::host_runtime::NativeRuntime)
//! and the sandbox execution paths in
//! [`crate::sandbox::ops`] can share one Windows-aware
//! implementation. Prior to this module the sandbox paths hardcoded
//! `Command::new("sh")`, which fails at `CreateProcessW` on Windows in
//! ~30ms because `sh` is not in `PATH` (#4705).
//!
//! **Shell choice per platform:**
//!
//! - **Windows** → `cmd.exe /C <command>`. Chosen over PowerShell because
//!   Windows users expect `%VAR%` expansion (`echo %USERPROFILE%`) and
//!   byte-transparent `>` / `2>` redirection for the sandboxed output-
//!   capture path in
//!   [`crate::sandbox::ops::execute_local_jail`]. PowerShell
//!   5.1's `>` writes UTF-16LE and does not expand `%VAR%`.
//! - **Unix** → `bash -lc "set -o pipefail\n<command>"` when bash is
//!   available at `/usr/bin/bash` or `/bin/bash`, otherwise `sh -lc
//!   <command>`. `set -o pipefail` surfaces a failed stage in a pipeline
//!   (e.g. `pip install … | tail`) as a non-zero exit instead of being
//!   masked by the last stage — without it the harness records the call
//!   as successful and the repeated-failure circuit breaker
//!   (`RepeatedToolFailureMiddleware`) never trips, so the agent loops
//!   on a silently-failing command. `/bin/sh` is dash on Debian/Ubuntu
//!   and rejects `set -o pipefail`, so this is gated on bash actually
//!   being present; otherwise we fall back to plain sh.
