//! JWT helpers for TinyHumans session tokens, from the SDK.

//! The core carries its own copy of these three functions in
//! `openhuman_core::security::credentials::jwt` because it needs them with no backend
//! dependency; this module exposes the SDK's originals for hosts that already
//! depend on this crate.
