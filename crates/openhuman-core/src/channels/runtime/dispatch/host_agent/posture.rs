//! What a host agent may do on a turn an outside sender started.
//!
//! A channel turn is [`AgentTurnOrigin::ExternalChannel`]: whoever can message
//! the bot wrote its text. On the orchestrator path an acting tool parks an
//! approval and, with no one to answer it, is denied when the park expires. A
//! host agent bound to a public channel must not wait on that: the sender is
//! the only person in the chat, and they are the one who must not approve it.
//! So the turn is capped at [`PermissionLevel::ReadOnly`] and anything above
//! that, or anything with an external effect, is refused on the spot with a
//! tool error the model can relay.
