//!
//! # What this is, relative to the rest of `embed`
//!
//! `Harness` is the one-agent convenience: a [`Runtime`](crate::Runtime)
//! plus exactly one [`Agent`](crate::Agent) named `harness`, built from one
//! set of inputs. Every method delegates to those two — [`Harness::runtime`]
//! and [`Harness::agent`] hand them out — so a host that outgrows one agent
//! creates more on the same runtime rather than a second harness.
//! [`Core`](crate::Core) is the layer below both: the typed facade over a
//! [`CoreRuntime`] the caller built themselves.
//!
//! # Running on your own endpoint
//!
//! A harness identifies as [`HostKind::Library`](openhuman_core::core::types::HostKind::Library)
//! by default. Supplying a [`Provider`] is therefore enough for inference: the
//! library host is trusted to supply its endpoint and credentials, without an
//! OpenHuman app login. Managed TinyHumans inference needs the runtime's
//! API key instead — [`RuntimeBuilder::api_key`](crate::RuntimeBuilder::api_key).
//!
//! The core can still make non-inference backend calls (integrations,
//! telemetry, managed services). [`HarnessBuilder::backend_url`] points them
//! at the embedding product's backend; [`HarnessBuilder::session`] installs a
//! backend identity when required.
//!
//! Neither applies to [`Provider::inherit`] with [`Workspace::Inherit`], which
//! runs exactly as the installed app does, session included.
//!
//! # Two things the harness cannot do for you
//!
//! **The tokio runtime is yours, and its stack size matters.** One agent turn is
//! an enormous async state machine, and delegating to a sub-agent nests another
//! inside it; tokio's default 2 MiB worker stack overflows and aborts the
//! process. Build the runtime with
//! [`AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES`](openhuman_core::core::runtime::AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES)
//! and [`MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS`](openhuman_core::core::runtime::MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use openhuman_core::core::runtime::{AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES, MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS};
//!
//! let runtime = tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
//!     .enable_all()
//!     .thread_stack_size(AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES)
//!     .max_blocking_threads(MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS)
//!     .build()
//!     .expect("tokio runtime");
//! ```
//!
//! **One runtime per process.** The keyring master key, the RPC bearer, the
//! global event bus and the `Once`-guarded domain subscribers are all
//! process-scoped. A harness owns a runtime, so a second harness is a second
//! runtime and [`HarnessBuilder::build`] returns
//! [`HarnessError::AlreadyRunning`]. Agents multiplex inside one runtime; see
//! [`Runtime`](crate::Runtime).
