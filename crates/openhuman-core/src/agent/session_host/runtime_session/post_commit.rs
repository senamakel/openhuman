//! The post-commit tail of a session turn.
//!
//! The runtime awaits the whole `after_commit` hook before `run_turn` returns.
//! The web caller publishes `chat_done` only after that return, and it first
//! waits for the progress bridge to see `TurnCompleted`. Every await in this
//! hook therefore sits between the turn's final model call and the user's
//! answer. Production traces showed 2.3–3.9s of untraced time there, about a
//! quarter of a median turn.
//!
//! The hook now does the work in this order:
//!
//! 1. Record the receipt-derived state the caller reads right after
//!    `run_turn` returns (cap flag, usage).
//! 2. Publish `TurnCompleted`. It is the progress bridge's drain fence, and
//!    nothing it gates depends on the steps below.
//! 3. Run the cheap, synchronous-ordering steps: the transcript mirror and
//!    memory ingest. Both only take state and spawn.
//! 4. Hand thread-goal accounting to a background task
//!    ([`complete_then_defer`]). The next turn awaits it before it loads the
//!    goal, so goal budgets still see every committed turn in order.
//!
//! Each step is timed under the `[session-runtime] post-commit` log prefix.
