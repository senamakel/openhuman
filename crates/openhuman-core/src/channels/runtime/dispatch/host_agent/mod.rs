//! Channel turns answered by a host-registered agent.
//!
//! `config.agent.channel_agents` binds a channel to an agent id
//! (`telegram = "teeny-chat"`). A message on a bound channel is resolved
//! through the host agent resolver ([`crate::agent::host_agents`]) and run as
//! that agent -- its definition, its host tools, its context -- instead of
//! going over the bus to the orchestrator. Everything else about the channel
//! stays: per-chat history, typing, drafts, the reply back to the chat.
//!
//! A binding the resolver cannot satisfy (the embedder has not created the
//! agent yet, or dropped it) is **refused**, with a short reply to the chat
//! and an error log. It is never widened to the orchestrator: the binding
//! exists because the channel is meant to reach one particular agent, and
//! the orchestrator holds the operator's full tool belt.
//!
//! The turn runs under the channel's `ExternalChannel` origin, passed down as
//! a parameter, and [`posture`] caps what the agent may do on it.
