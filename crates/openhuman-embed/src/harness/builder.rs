//! Assembling a [`Harness`].
//!
//! The builder splits its inputs between the two things a harness is: the
//! runtime-wide ones (workspace, services, domains, backend URL, session,
//! base config) go to a [`RuntimeBuilder`], and the agent-shaped ones
//! (provider, access, action directory, skills, MCP servers) go to one
//! [`AgentSpec`] named `harness`. Nothing here mutates the process
//! environment.
