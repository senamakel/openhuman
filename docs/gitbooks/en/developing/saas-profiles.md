# SaaS profiles

The OpenHuman core can serve many users from one process. Each user is one
**profile**: their own config, credential, workspace, sandbox and threads,
laid out like the desktop app's `users/<id>/` directory. A trusted gateway in
front of the core authenticates users and calls the core on their behalf. The
core never sees a user's password or login; it trusts the gateway's service
token and the user id the gateway names.

This page covers deploying that service. The in-process variant, for a Rust
server that wants the same isolation without a gateway, is
[`ProfileRuntime`](embed/concepts/profiles-saas.md).
The internals are in
[`profiles/README.md`](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/blob/main/crates/openhuman-core/src/profiles/README.md).

## What a user gets

- **One profile per user.** It is opened on the user's first request, kept
  while in use, and closed after `idle_evict_secs` of idleness (or when
  `max_profiles_open` is reached and it is the least recently used idle one).
- **One thread per conversation, per interface.** Web chat threads are named
  by the user (`t1`, `work-notes`); a message the gateway relays from a
  hosted platform (Telegram, iMessage, Discord) lands on that user's
  `channel:<platform>/<sender>/<chat>` thread. Thread ids are unique per
  profile, so two users' `t1` never meet.
- **A reviewed surface.** A user's requests reach only the user methods:
  their threads, web chat (start, cancel, queue control), the channel relay,
  and reads and writes of their own memory. Everything else answers as an
  unknown method.
- **Their own events.** `GET /events?client_id=` streams only that user's
  chat progress, final replies and relayed `channel_outbound` replies.
- **Closed tools by default.** No shell or file tool reaches the host unless
  the operator opts users into `host_files` or `host_shell`; `host_shell`
  runs every command in a locked-down Docker container whose only writable
  mount is the user's `sandbox/`.

## Operator config

The core runs in SaaS mode from the operator's own TOML file, never from a
user's `config.toml`:

```bash
openhuman-core run --mode saas --saas-config /etc/openhuman/saas.toml
```

```toml
root = "/srv/openhuman"              # absolute, existing, not world-writable
# service_token_file = "/srv/openhuman/service.token"   # the default
max_profiles_open = 256              # profiles open at once on this node
idle_evict_secs = 1800               # close a profile idle this long
profile_ids = "raw"                  # or "hashed"
require_user_signature = true        # X-OpenHuman-User-Sig on every user request
tool_allowlist = []                  # "host_files", "host_shell"
shared_backend_api_key = true        # let every user ride OPENHUMAN_BACKEND_API_KEY
custom_definitions = false

# Cluster settings (see below)
# storage_url = "mongodb://db.internal/openhuman"   # OPENHUMAN_STORAGE_URL wins
# node_id = "node-a"                                # else OPENHUMAN_NODE_ID, else random
# advertise_url = "http://10.0.0.11:7788"           # marks the node as clustered
# lease_ttl_secs = 30
# operator_dir = "/var/lib/openhuman/node-a"        # default <root>/operator

[sandbox]                            # only used with host_shell
image = "alpine:3.20"
network = "none"
memory_limit_mb = 512
cpu_limit = 1.0
```

Unknown keys are refused. The boot guard refuses to start, listing every
problem at once, when the root is relative, missing, world-writable or inside
`~/.openhuman`; when the service token is missing, readable by others or
shorter than 32 bytes; when single-user variables are set
(`OPENHUMAN_WORKSPACE`, `OPENHUMAN_CORE_TOKEN`, `OPENHUMAN_DEV_CONNECT`,
`OPENHUMAN_BACKEND_SESSION_TOKEN`) or a protection is switched off
(`OPENHUMAN_APPROVAL_GATE`, `OPENHUMAN_SANDBOX`); when `host_shell` is
allowlisted without a working Docker; and when a clustered node has no
storage backend that can keep leases exclusive.

Write the service token once, owner-only:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > /srv/openhuman/service.token
chmod 600 /srv/openhuman/service.token
```

## The gateway contract

Every request carries the service token. A request for a user also names the
user and signs that name:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <service token>
X-OpenHuman-User: <your user id>
X-OpenHuman-User-Sig: t=<unix secs>,v1=<hex hmac-sha256(service token, "<t>.<user id>")>
```

- Without `X-OpenHuman-User` the request runs on the **operator plane**:
  `profiles.provision`, `deprovision`, `list`, `status`, `set_credential`,
  `clear_credential` and `release` (`openhuman.profiles_*` over JSON-RPC).
- With it, the core checks, in order: the bearer (`401`), a duplicate or
  unreadable user header (`400`), the signature, which must be within 60
  seconds of the core's clock (`401`), and the user's profile, which must
  already be provisioned (`403`). A full node or a storage failure answers
  `503`.
- The user's TinyHumans credential (session JWT or API key) goes in once
  through `profiles.set_credential`; the core uses it for that user's
  inference and backend calls and never validates or echoes it.

A minimal signer:

```python
import hashlib, hmac, time

def sign(service_token: str, user_id: str) -> str:
    t = int(time.time())
    tag = hmac.new(service_token.encode(), f"{t}.{user_id}".encode(), hashlib.sha256)
    return f"t={t},v1={tag.hexdigest()}"
```

### Profile ids

With `profile_ids = "raw"`, a user id matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`
is the profile id as is (`local`, `operator` and `h-*` are reserved); any
other id becomes `h-<32 hex of sha256(user id)>`. `"hashed"` hashes every id,
which keeps your user ids out of paths and logs. Changing the mode maps users
onto new, empty profiles.

### Relaying hosted chat platforms

The gateway owns each platform's webhook and the user's account link. For
each inbound message it calls, as that user:

```json
{"method": "openhuman.channel_relay_inbound",
 "params": {"channel": "telegram", "chat_id": "777", "sender_id": "555",
            "sender_name": "Alice", "message_id": "tg-1", "text": "hello",
            "client_id": "channel-relay"}}
```

The answer comes at once (`accepted`, `thread_id`, `request_id`); a
`message_id` already recorded answers `duplicate: true` and runs nothing, so
retries are safe. The reply arrives on the user's
`/events?client_id=channel-relay` stream as a `channel_outbound` event
carrying `full_response` and the `channel` and `chat_id` to deliver it to.

## One node

On a single node, leave `storage_url` and `advertise_url` unset. The profile
registry is `profile.toml` files under `<root>/users/`, and each profile's
lease is a file lock on `<root>/users/<id>/.lease`, which also keeps a
second process on the same root from opening the same profile.

## A cluster

Several nodes can serve one user base. Each profile is hosted by exactly one
node at a time, enforced by a **lease** in a shared storage backend; any node
can host any profile.

1. **One storage backend.** Set `storage_url` (or `OPENHUMAN_STORAGE_URL`) to
   a driver whose compare-and-swap is atomic across processes: MongoDB
   (`mongodb://…/<db>`, the `storage-mongodb` build feature) for nodes on
   several hosts, or SQLite (`sqlite:<path>`, `storage-sqlite`) for several
   processes on one host. Do not put SQLite on a network filesystem. It holds the
   profile registry, the leases, the session store, and each profile's
   records (secrets, auth profiles, approvals, cron, flows) under scope
   `profile:<id>`.
2. **One shared volume for `root`.** Thread files, the cost and run ledgers,
   background completions and each user's `sandbox/` are still files under
   `<root>/users/<id>/`. Mount `root` on a read-write-many volume (NFS, EFS,
   CephFS) on every node. Keep memory on a remote engine: profiles use the
   hosted TinyHumans memory engine, which needs no volume.
3. **A unique, stable `node_id` per node,** and an `advertise_url` the gateway
   can reach it on. Setting `advertise_url` marks the node as clustered; the
   boot guard then insists on a cross-process backend. A stable node id lets
   a restarted node take its own profiles back at once.
4. **Its own `operator_dir` per node,** so nodes sharing a root do not share
   the operator workspace and keyring.

### Routing and the 409

Route users stickily: hash the user id onto a node (consistent hashing keeps
most users in place when nodes come and go). Stickiness is only for speed;
the lease is what makes it correct. When a request reaches a node while
another node holds that user's profile, the core answers:

```text
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
X-OpenHuman-Profile-Owner: node-b

{"error": "profile_held", "owner": "node-b",
 "endpoint": "http://10.0.0.12:7788", "retry_after_ms": 21500}
```

The gateway should forward the request to `endpoint` (and update its routing
for that user), or, when `endpoint` is null or unreachable, retry after
`retry_after_ms`. The `409` comes only after the bearer check, so an
unauthenticated caller learns nothing about which users exist.

To move a user deliberately (draining a node, rebalancing), call
`profiles.release {"profile_id": ...}` on the node that holds it. It refuses
while the profile is in use; retry shortly.

### Failover and recovery

- A holder renews each lease every third of `lease_ttl_secs`. A node that
  crashes or loses the backend stops renewing, and its profiles become
  available to other nodes once their leases expire (at most
  `lease_ttl_secs`, 30 seconds by default).
- The node that takes over a lease that was never released recovers the
  profile before serving it: turns that were in flight are marked
  interrupted and orphaned run-ledger rows are settled. A clean hand-over
  (idle eviction, release, shutdown) recovers nothing.
- A node that finds its lease changed under it (another node took over, or
  an operator released it) fences the profile: it stops that profile's
  running turns and starts no new ones.
- On a clean shutdown a node releases the leases of its idle profiles at
  once; a profile still busy keeps its lease, so its next holder recovers its
  turns.

Known limit: storage writes carry no epoch fence, so a node that is
partitioned from the backend but still running could write briefly after its
lease expired. Keep `lease_ttl_secs` well above network hiccups, and treat
the fence check before each turn and the turn cancellation on loss as the
mitigation.

## Checklist

- `root` absolute, not world-writable, on a shared RWX volume (cluster).
- `service.token` mode `0600`, at least 32 bytes, shared with the gateway only.
- Gateway signs `X-OpenHuman-User` and keeps clocks in sync (±60 s).
- `storage_url` on MongoDB (or SQLite for processes on one host), with the
  matching build feature (cluster).
- `node_id`, `advertise_url` and `operator_dir` unique per node (cluster).
- Load balancer hashes users stickily and honours `409` redirects.
- Provision a user (`profiles.provision`) and install their credential
  (`profiles.set_credential`) before their first request.
