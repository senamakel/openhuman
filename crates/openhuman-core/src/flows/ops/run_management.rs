/// - **Parked / stale** (a `pending_approval` run awaiting a human decision, or
///   a `running` row whose task is gone): no live task exists to unwind, so
///   this settles the row terminally itself and drops the checkpoint.
///
/// A run that is already terminal (`completed` / `completed_with_warnings` /
/// `failed` / `cancelled` / `interrupted`) is a clear error, not a silent
/// no-op — otherwise a settled warning run could be overwritten as
/// `"cancelled"`, corrupting the run-honesty status it already recorded, and an
/// already-`interrupted` run (reconciled by the drop-guard / boot sweep, bug
/// B42) could be clobbered back to `"cancelled"`.
