//! A finished turn must release every clone of its progress sender once the
//! caller clears the sink. The web channel's progress bridge only exits when
//! its receiver closes, so a clone retained by the cached session (the
//! committed receipt's run context carries `progress` and the attached
//! parent's `on_progress`) kept one bridge task — and in SaaS mode its
//! profile's turn context — alive per turn.
