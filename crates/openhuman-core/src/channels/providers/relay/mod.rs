//! Hosted-channel relay: messages from a chat platform the core does not
//! listen to itself, relayed in by a gateway as the user they belong to.
//!
//! In SaaS the cloud gateway owns the hosted Telegram, iMessage and Discord
//! webhooks and the account links (`openhuman_tinyhumans::hosted::channel_link`).
//! For each message it calls `channel_relay_inbound` under that user's scope.
//! The core:
//!
//! 1. validates the message ([`params`]) and derives its thread,
//!    `channel:<channel>/<sender>/<chat>` (`channels::bus::derive_inbound_thread_id`);
//! 2. records the message on that thread in the caller's workspace
//!    ([`store`]), refusing a duplicate `message_id`;
//! 3. runs the turn through the channel dispatch pipeline
//!    (`channels::runtime`), under the channel's `ExternalChannel` origin, with
//!    a runtime context built from the caller's config ([`ops`]);
//! 4. publishes each reply as a `channel_outbound` event on the caller's
//!    `/events` stream ([`RelayChannel`]) and records it on the thread.
//!
//! It works in a single-user core too (an embedder's or a local relay), where
//! the caller's config is the process's.
