# `openhuman-embed`

`openhuman-embed` is the host-facing library package for products that run the
OpenHuman core in-process, including OpenCompany. It re-exports the
runtime builder from `openhuman-core` and owns the typed embedding facade. See
[`gitbooks/developing/embedding.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/embedding.md)
for the narrative walkthrough this README's reference material supports.

Use the default contributor feature set:

```toml
[dependencies]
openhuman-embed = { git = "https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman", package = "openhuman-embed" }
```

Or select a narrow host build:

```toml
[dependencies]
openhuman-embed = { git = "https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman", package = "openhuman-embed", default-features = false, features = ["inference", "mcp"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;

use openhuman_embed::{Core, CoreBuilder, DomainSet, HostKind, ServiceSet};

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let runtime = CoreBuilder::new(HostKind::Library)
    .domains(DomainSet::embedded())
    .services(ServiceSet::none())
    .build()
    .await?;
let core = Core::from_runtime(Arc::new(runtime));
let flags = core.config().runtime_flags().await?;
println!("log_prompts={}", flags.log_prompts);
# Ok(())
# }
```

Embedding products should set their product identity once during startup,
before constructing backend clients:

```rust
use openhuman_tinyhumans::{set_product_identity, ProductIdentity};

if let Some(identity) = ProductIdentity::new("opencompany") {
    set_product_identity(identity);
}
```

Use `Core::raw()` only as a temporary escape hatch when the typed facade does
not yet model a required call. A repeated raw call is a candidate for a typed
embedding method in `openhuman-embed`.

## Two steps: a `Runtime`, then any number of `Agent`s

The library API. Initialize one runtime (features, services, backend URL,
the TinyHumans API key), then instantiate agents on it, each fully described
and independent of the others:

For hosted TinyHumans inference and services, use
[`openhuman_tinyhumans::RuntimeBuilder`](../openhuman-tinyhumans/README.md),
which binds the backend transport during startup. The
[minimal library recipe](../../docs/library-minimal-recipe.md) covers the
dependency and feature selection. The plain embed builder supports standalone
hosts with their own providers; hosted requests require an installed transport
and otherwise return `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:`.

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_tinyhumans::{
    embed::{Access, AgentSpec, McpServer, Provider, Workspace},
    RuntimeBuilder,
};

# async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let runtime = RuntimeBuilder::new()
    .workspace(Workspace::dir("/var/lib/my-product/openhuman"))
    .api_key("th_live_…")                     // the only credential in library mode
    .build()
    .await?;

let reviewer = runtime.agent(
    AgentSpec::new("reviewer")
        .system_prompt("You review pull requests and never edit files.")
        .access(Access::readonly())
        .skills_dir("./skills/review")        // copied into this agent's own skills root
        .action_dir("/srv/checkouts/pr-42"),
)?;

let fixer = runtime.agent(
    AgentSpec::new("fixer")
        .provider(Provider::openai_compatible("https://api.example/v1", "sk-…").model("gpt-5"))
        .access(Access::full())
        .mcp(McpServer::stdio("github", "gh-mcp", ["stdio"]))
        .action_dir("/srv/checkouts/pr-42"),
)?;

let review = reviewer.run("Summarise the risks in this change.").await?;
let fix = fixer
    .turn(format!("Address these findings:\n{}", review.reply))
    .send()
    .await?;
println!("{}", fix.reply);

// Continue a conversation with the same agent.
let again = fixer.turn("Now run the tests.").session(&fix.session_id).send().await?;
println!("{}", again.reply);
# Ok(())
# }
```

What each agent owns: its provider route and model, its access tier and
turn origin, its `action_dir`, its MCP servers, its skills root
(`<workspace>/agents/<id>/skills/`), its system prompt, tool scope and
sandbox mode (`AgentDefinitionSpec`), and a narrowed `DomainSet` /
`ToolGroups`. Every turn is
dispatched under the agent's own `CoreContext`, so the core's config loader,
domain gate, tool-group filter and skill discovery all read that agent's
settings and never another's. Transcripts are keyed by agent id and a turn
resumes only its own thread.

What the runtime owns: the workspace and credential store, the event bus,
the keyring, the background `ServiceSet`, the registered `DomainSet` (agents
can only narrow it, so enable `mcp` / `skills` at runtime build time if any
agent will use them; the default does), and the API key.

Layout under a runtime-owned root:

```text
<root>/config.toml, auth-profiles.json, core.token
<root>/workspace/session_db/, session_raw/<ts>_<agent>.jsonl, agents/<agent>/skills/
<root>/agents/<agent>/action/                  default action_dir
```

### Backend connection

The core knows the hosted TinyHumans backend only through
`BackendTransport` (re-exported here). `openhuman-embed` alone installs
none: agents, memory, skills, tools and RPC run without any TinyHumans
connection, and calls to hosted-backend surfaces answer with a typed
`BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:` error. This includes managed inference, billing,
`/agent-integrations/*` tools, cloud voice, and session-bound surfaces such as
channel relay. Use `openhuman-tinyhumans`, whose
`RuntimeBuilder` mirrors this one and installs the SDK-backed transport on
`build()`, or pass your own to `RuntimeBuilder::backend_transport`. See
[`gitbooks/developing/tinyhumans-api-key.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/tinyhumans-api-key.md)
for what that one key then unlocks.

### Authentication

Library mode has no user login. `RuntimeBuilder::api_key` installs a
TinyHumans API key into the runtime's credential store before the core boots;
managed inference then sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` to the
TinyHumans OpenAI-compatible endpoint, backend REST calls send it as
`x-api-key`, and the scheduler gate treats the runtime as signed in. No
`/auth/me` round trip, no session JWT, nothing to expire. An agent that names
its own `Provider` (BYOK) never touches the key.

The key covers every hosted feature the core reaches: managed inference, cloud
embeddings, voice (STT and TTS), web search, media generation, the Jev ranker,
Composio and the other `/agent-integrations/*` tools, referral, and webhooks.
The realtime voice agent and Socket.IO relay require a signed-in user session. Callers that
can only send a bearer (the vendored STT and embedding clients, the connector
module's proxy route, the memory engine's sync) send the key as
`Authorization: Bearer`, which the backend accepts because it recognises the
`tiny_live_` / `tiny_test_` prefix. What a key may reach is decided by its
scopes on the backend: `inference`, `voice`, `search`, `media`, `storage`,
`account` and `connections` (Composio). A key minted through the grant flow
omits `connections` unless it is asked for; a missing scope answers `403`.
The session-bound `/auth/*` flows (OAuth connect, channel link tokens, login
tokens), the realtime voice agent, and the Socket.IO relay still need a
signed-in user.

`HarnessBuilder::session`
remains for hosts that drive backend features on behalf of a signed-in user;
the core stores that session as handed over (`auth.set_credential`) and never
validates it: obtaining and validating a JWT is the host's job (see
`openhuman_tinyhumans::session`).

### `Harness`: the one-agent shorthand

`Harness` is a `Runtime` plus exactly one `Agent` (id `harness`), built from
one set of inputs. Existing callers keep working; `harness.runtime()` and
`harness.agent()` hand out the two halves, so a host that outgrows one agent
creates more on the same runtime.

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_embed::{Access, Harness, Provider, Workspace};

# async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let harness = Harness::builder()
    .provider(Provider::openai_compatible("https://api.example/v1", "sk-…").model("gpt-5"))
    .workspace(Workspace::Ephemeral)
    .access(Access::readonly())
    .build()
    .await?;

let first = harness.run("Summarize what you can see.").await?;
let second = harness
    .turn("Now list the risks.")
    .session(&first.session_id)
    .send()
    .await?;
println!("{}", second.reply);
# Ok(())
# }
```

`Core` is the typed facade shown at the top: a host that already built a
`CoreRuntime` wraps it with `Core::from_runtime` and reaches sub-facades
through it: `config()`, `auth()`, and `agent()` (a `CoreAgent` running the
orchestrator).

### One runtime per process

The keyring master key, the RPC bearer, the global event bus and the
`Once`-guarded domain subscribers are process-scoped
(`openhuman_core::core::runtime::context::CoreContext::init` runs that
sequence), so a second runtime would silently share them while believing it
had a separate workspace. `RuntimeBuilder::build` returns
`RuntimeError::AlreadyRunning` instead; agents are the unit of multiplicity.
`Core::from_runtime` is not guarded (it only wraps a runtime the host
already built), but the same constraint applies to the `CoreRuntime` beneath
it.

Build the tokio runtime yourself. A turn is a large async state machine that
overflows tokio's default 2 MiB worker stack once a sub-agent nests inside it,
so use `AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES` and `MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS` from
[`openhuman_core::core::runtime`](../openhuman-core/src/core/runtime/README.md):

```rust,no_run
use openhuman_core::core::runtime::{AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES, MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS};

let runtime = tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
    .enable_all()
    .thread_stack_size(AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES)
    .max_blocking_threads(MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS)
    .build()
    .expect("tokio runtime");
```

### Memory per tenant

Bind each agent with `AgentSpec::memory(MemoryBinding::new(agent_id).root("team:acme"))`
and its turns run TinyMemory's lifecycle under `team:acme/agent:<agent_id>`.
`Runtime::memory("team:acme")` is the operator's view of that tenant: its
agents, items, learnings and brain. Every call stays inside the root's subtree.
`RuntimeBuilder::memory_engine` installs a host-supplied engine in place of the
configured one. See `docs/specs/memory-v2.md`.

### Conversations in a host store

By default an agent's transcripts, turn journal, run status, goals and todos
are files under the runtime's workspace. A host serving many users from one
process keeps them in its own database instead:

```rust,ignore
let runtime = Runtime::builder()
    .workspace(Workspace::stateless())          // nothing durable on disk
    .session_store(Arc::new(MyMongoStores::new(db)))
    .build()
    .await?;
```

The runtime asks the provider (`session_store::SessionStoreProvider`) for
each agent's stores by agent id, so a provider over a shared database scopes
every query by agent and one agent can never reach another's conversation. A
reopened agent resumes its thread from the store, in any process.
`InMemorySessionStores` keeps everything in memory; the conformance suites in
`session_store` are what a host's provider is held to.
`Workspace::stateless()` refuses to build without a store, and a private
scratch directory, removed with the runtime, still holds process-local
caches (cost log, prompt templates, migration markers). The desktop app, CLI
and TUI install `openhuman_rpc::session_store`, the classic on-disk layout behind
the same port. See `tests/session_store.rs`.

### Scheduling

`Runtime::cron()` upserts named jobs (`JobSpec::agent` for a turn of a
runtime agent with its host tools, `JobSpec::system` for a handler registered
with `Runtime::on_system_job`), lists, removes, runs them now and reads their
history. A `ServiceSet` with `cron: true` starts the scheduler on `build()`
and stops it with the runtime; `start_services` / `stop_services` control it
explicitly. See [`gitbooks/developing/embedding.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/embedding.md#scheduling)
and `tests/cron_agents.rs`.

### Still runtime-wide

These are read from the runtime's boot config by every agent today. They
are documented rather than hidden; each is a candidate follow-up in the core.

- `autonomy.auto_approve` / `auto_approve_all` and the memory guard's
  autonomy tier come from the runtime's boot config (`security::live_policy`),
  not the agent's. Path and command policy _do_ use the agent's own tier.
- The approval gate is on or off process-wide; parked approvals are not
  labelled with the agent id. A per-agent "no approvals" is `Access::full()`,
  whose `TrustedAutomation` origin the gate honours per turn.
- The sub-agent catalogue is runtime-wide (built-ins plus
  `<workspace>/agents/*.toml`). Embedded agents cannot be `delegate_*`
  targets of one another. Do not reuse built-in ids (`orchestrator`,
  `summarizer`, …) for your agents.
- Sub-agents an agent spawns and the experience store re-read the runtime's
  on-disk config rather than the agent's overlay. (The turn journal goes to
  the agent's own stores under a host session store; without one it uses the
  process-default workspace.)
- Sub-agent run-ledger rows, cron jobs and the cost log stay in the
  workspace even with a host session store.
- Agents sharing a workspace share the dynamic (`mcp_registry_*`) MCP
  registry; `[[mcp_client.servers]]` declared through `AgentSpec::mcp` are
  per agent. The host-seeded documentation server is visible to every agent.
- `install_skill` / `create_skill` still write to `~/.openhuman`. With
  `include_user_skills(false)` (the default) an agent does not _discover_ the
  operator's skills, but an install by the agent lands there.
- One API key (or session) is shared by all agents.
- `IntegrationClient` (backend-proxied Composio/search/media tools) accepts
  the runtime's TinyHumans API key or an app-session JWT through
  `security::credentials::session_support::resolve_backend_credential`.
  API keys use `x-api-key`; session JWTs use `Authorization: Bearer`.
  With the backend transport installed and the integration feature and runtime
  gates enabled, an API-key-only runtime can register integration tools.

Other invariants worth knowing before wiring any entry point:

- When building a `CoreRuntime` yourself, set `config_path` together with
  `workspace_dir` (`CoreBuilder::workspace(dir)` does both). Credentials,
  auth profiles and the keyring file resolve beside `config_path`, so a
  workspace-only override reads the operator's real credentials. `Runtime`
  and `Harness` set both for `Workspace::Ephemeral` and `Workspace::Dir`.
- A turn runs under the access tier _and_ the turn origin. `Access::full()`
  sets both (`AutonomyLevel::Full` plus a `TrustedAutomation` origin);
  `Access::readonly()` and `Access::supervised()` set no origin and leave the
  approval gate on. `Access::public()` is for untrusted public input: an
  `ExternalChannel` origin, the policy enabled at `ReadOnly`, and every
  acting tool refused immediately rather than parked.
- `AgentSpec::lockdown()` turns a `ToolScopeSpec::Named` belt into a tool
  ceiling every nested run (sub-agents, `run_workflow`, schedules, flows)
  inherits or refuses; `Agent::effective_tools(origin)` reports what a turn
  can reach. See "Running a public agent" in `gitbooks/developing/embedding.md`.
- Supply skills through `AgentSpec::skills_dir` / `HarnessBuilder::skills_dir`,
  which copy the bundles. Skill discovery rejects symlinked bundles, so
  linking them in does not work.

## Feature flags

Every feature on this crate is a pass-through to the same-named feature on
`openhuman-core` (package `openhuman`): `default`, `http-server`,
`inference`, `documents`, `hosting`, `modules`, `voice`, `web3`,
`runtime-node`, `media`, `flows`, `skills`, `mcp`, `crash-reporting`,
`channels`, `whatsapp-web`, `file-logging`, `scheduler-gate`, and the
capability features `tools-shell`, `tools-fs-write`, `tools-exec`,
`tools-system` and `composio`, which remove host-acting agent-tool families
from the build. The
[capability features](../../gitbooks/developing/embedding.md#capability-features)
section lists the tools each one covers.

Two of them also gate items on this crate's own public surface:

- `mcp`: `HttpHeader`, `McpAuthConfig`, `McpServer`, `AgentSpec::mcp` and
  `HarnessBuilder::mcp`.
- `skills`: `AgentSpec::skills_dir` and `HarnessBuilder::skills_dir`.

See [`docs/library-minimal-recipe.md`](../../docs/library-minimal-recipe.md)
for a measured minimal-footprint feature set, and
[`gitbooks/developing/performance.md`](../../gitbooks/developing/performance.md)
for the resulting binary sizes and per-agent memory numbers.

## Examples and tests

```bash
# Against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_API_KEY=sk-… \
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_MODEL=gpt-5 \
  cargo run -p openhuman-embed --example run_turn -- "What can you see in this directory?"

# Or against the machine's own configured inference, in its real workspace:
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_INHERIT=1 cargo run -p openhuman-embed --example run_turn -- "Hello."
```

Optional: `OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_BACKEND_URL` points non-inference backend calls
somewhere specific, and `OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_SKILLS_DIR` supplies skill bundles.

Two agents on one runtime, either BYOK with the same variables as above, or
managed inference with `OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_TINYHUMANS_API_KEY`:

```bash
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_API_KEY=sk-… \
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_MODEL=gpt-5 \
  cargo run -p openhuman-embed --example two_agents -- "Describe this directory."

# Or managed inference, no BYOK endpoint needed:
OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_TINYHUMANS_API_KEY=th_… \
  cargo run -p openhuman-embed --example two_agents -- "Describe this directory."
```

The repository-root `examples/embed_headless.rs` (`DomainSet::harness()`,
`ServiceSet::none()`, RPC through `CoreRuntime::invoke`) and
`examples/embed_kernel.rs` (`DomainSet::kernel()`, then opt one family back
in) drive `CoreBuilder` from `openhuman_core` directly, without this crate;
they are `[[example]]` entries of the `openhuman` package, so run them with
`cargo run --example embed_headless`.

`tests/harness_embed.rs` is the end-to-end proof that `Harness` runs a real
turn against a `wiremock` provider with nothing bound;
`tests/runtime_agents.rs` runs three agents with different providers, access
tiers, skills, MCP servers and working directories on one runtime and shows
the API key reaching a mocked managed backend as a bearer;
`tests/cron_agents.rs` runs a cron job as a runtime agent with its host tool
under the `TrustedAutomation { Cron }` origin, records a system job handler's
error, and starts and stops the scheduler with the runtime;
`tests/public_api.rs` pins the host-facing embedding contract at compile
time. Run them with `cargo test -p openhuman-embed --features inference,mcp,skills`.

## Relationship to other crates

Its only in-repo dependency is `openhuman-core` (package `openhuman`) with
`default-features = false`: every capability comes from a feature forwarded
above. It does not depend on `openhuman-rpc`; `Outcome` and `StructuredRpcError`
are core types (`openhuman_core::core`). `openhuman-app` and `openhuman-tui`
depend on `openhuman-rpc` for its client (and the app on its server) and on
`openhuman-core`; neither uses `openhuman-embed`.

## Permanent tools on supplied agents

Hosts can pass an existing configured `Agent` to another library, which adds
its tools through `Agent::attach_tools` without constructing a replacement.
Attachments are shared by clones, always directly advertised, and update only
their managed system catalogue when a continuing conversation gains tools.
See [agent attachment semantics and example](src/agent/README.md#attach-tools-to-an-existing-agent)
for source identity, collision errors, policy composition, and runtime identity.
