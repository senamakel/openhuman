  // behind `s.thread.capabilities.dictation` (`thread.tsx`), and the runtime
  // derives that capability from nothing but the key's presence —
  // `dictation: this._store.adapters?.dictation !== void 0`. Supplying the
  // adapter would light the button up immediately. It would also trap the user.
  //
  // Measured in a WKWebView harness, which is the engine Wry gives us on macOS:
  //
  //   no Info.plist            `webkitSpeechRecognition` present, start() →
  //                            onerror "service-not-allowed"
  //   + NSMicrophoneUsage…     `webkitSpeechRecognition` present, start() →
  //     + NSSpeechRecognition…  NO EVENT AT ALL within 6s
  //
  // The second row is the dangerous one. A detectable error could be caught and
  // the capability withdrawn; silence cannot. The composer would enter
  // `dictation != null`, never leave it, and `StopDictation` would be the only
  // way out — an affordance that looks like it works, unlike the merely inert
  // Edit / BranchPicker / Reload controls gated off in #5897 and #6467.
  //
  // This is NOT "speech is impossible here". The app already ships working
  // speech-to-text by a different route: the `mic-cloud` composer captures with
  // `MediaRecorder` and transcribes through the core's `voice_*` RPC
  // (`features/human/voice/sttClient.ts`), with `voice` in
  // `scripts/ci/product-features.txt`. Its entry point is the "Voice mode" mic
  // button rendered a few pixels from the dictation gate it would duplicate.
  // The desktop `Info.plist` even describes that path — it declares
  // `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` ("voice dictation") and, tellingly, no
  // `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`, which only the mobile plist carries.
  //
  // Inline dictation into the composer is still worth having; it should reuse
  // that shipped capture + transcription rather than Web Speech. Tracked
  // separately — it needs a capture lifecycle, interim results, cancellation
  // and error surfacing, none of which this key would provide.
