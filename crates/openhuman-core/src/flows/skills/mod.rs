//! Skills the flows domain ships inside the binary.
//!
//! `flow-authoring` is the Workflow Builder's reference manual. It used to be
//! ~25 KB of the agent's system prompt — paid on every turn of every authoring
//! session, including the turns that only wire two nodes together. As a bundled
//! skill the same text is one `read_workflow_resource` call away and costs
//! nothing until a page is actually needed.
//!
//! The split follows one rule, and it is the reason the whole prompt did not
//! move: **a rule that binds goes in the prompt; a rule you look up goes
//! here.** "Propose, never persist" cannot live in a manual, because a manual
//! only binds a model that chose to open it. An expression's jq syntax is the
//! opposite — nothing goes wrong by not knowing it until you need it, and a
//! lot goes wrong by half-remembering it.
//!
//! The line is not obvious from the outside, and getting it wrong is caught by
//! tests rather than by review: "prefer the minimal viable graph" was moved
//! here on the first pass and moved back, because
//! `standing_prompt_keeps_minimal_graph_warning_alongside_specialist_guidance`
//! pins it in the prompt — correctly. It constrains an instinct the model has
//! before it would think to consult anything.
//!
//! # Where this belongs eventually
//!
//! Upstream, in tinyflows. The pages name no OpenHuman type and no host
//! concept beyond the tool slugs, so moving them is a directory move plus a
//! changed `include_str!` path. The pinned `vendor/tinyflows` submodule has no
//! crate to hold them yet — there is no `tinyflows-copilot` in it — so they sit
//! with the flows domain here in the meantime. Keeping them free of host
//! coupling is what keeps that move cheap; do not reach into `crate::` from a
//! page.
