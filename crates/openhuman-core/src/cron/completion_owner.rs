//! Which agent a just-completed cron job belonged to.
//!
//! `CronJobCompleted` names only the job, and a one-shot job
//! (`delete_after_run`) is already gone from the store by the time a
//! subscriber sees the event, so its owner cannot be looked up there. The
//! scheduler publishes the event inside the job's own task, which carries the
//! agent's context, and notes the owner here first; the notification bridge
//! takes it back out (`desktop::notifications`).
//!
//! In-process only — the bus delivers locally — and bounded: if no subscriber
//! drains it (the bridge is not registered), it is cleared rather than grown.
