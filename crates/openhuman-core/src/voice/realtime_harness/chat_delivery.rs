/// orchestrator behave like the chat path for tools that need a *routable*
/// approval surface:
///
/// - `composio_connect` fails closed with a `[policy-denied] … needs an
///   interactive chat turn` message whenever `APPROVAL_CHAT_CONTEXT` is absent
///   (see `integrations/composio/tools.rs`). On voice that message got
///   paraphrased back to the user as "your Gmail connection is throwing an auth
///   error, reconnect it" — the exact voice-only Gmail-summary failure — even
///   though the same request works in tap-and-speak (a `WebChat` turn, which
///   installs this context). With the context set, the tool reaches its
///   already-connected short-circuit and returns success instead.
/// - external_effect tool approvals raised on the `ExternalChannel` turn now
///   have a thread card to route to (the same `proactive:voice` thread where
///   deferred voice answers land) rather than silently TTL-denying.
/// - `with_thread_id` gives async delegation (`spawn_async_subagent`) the
///   `parent_thread_id` it requires and aligns inference logs / KV-cache with
///   the voice thread.
